This is the distribution of the Quantum-ESPRESSO suite of codes (ESPRESSO: 
opEn-Source Package for Research in Electronic Structure, Simulation, 
and Optimization), promoted by the DEMOCRITOS National Simulation Center 
of the Italian INFM (http://www.democritos.it). It contains the following 
codes for density-functional theory calculations of electronic structure,
based on plane waves and pseudopotentials:

- the PWscf package, developed by Stefano Baroni, Stefano de Gironcoli, 
  Andrea Dal Corso (SISSA, Trieste), Paolo Giannozzi (Scuola Normale,
  Pisa) and others: see http://www.pwscf.org for more information

- the CP code, developed by Alfredo Pasquarello (IRRMA, Lausanne),
  Kari Laasonen (Oulu), Andrea Trave (LLNL), Roberto Car
  (Princeton), Paolo Giannozzi, Nicola Marzari (MIT),
  Carlo Cavazzoni (CINECA, Bologna), Sandro Scandolo (ICTP, Trieste), 
  Guido Chiarotti (SISSA, Trieste), Paolo Focher, 
  Gerardo Ballabio (CINECA, Bologna) and others, 
  for Car-Parrinello variable-cell molecular dynamics 

Several utilities are also included, in particular:

- a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for generating input data files,
  written by Anton Kokalj (IJS Ljubljana) (for more info, see 
  http://www-k3.ijs.si/kokalj/pwgui , http://www-k3.ijs.si/kokalj/guib/)

- the pseudopotential generation code "atomic", written by Andrea Dal Corso

- the Input/Output Toolkit "iotk", written by Giovanni Bussi (S3 Modena)
  (for more info, see http://www.s3.infm.it/iotk)

This distribution is a step in the ongoing work aiming at a full 
integration and interoperability of these codes. This project is 
part of a cooperative effort involving DEMOCRITOS, CINECA, Princeton 
University, MIT.
