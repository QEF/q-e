TEST-SUITE  v1.0.0
------------------

Type 'make' for the list of possible 

You can run make with several options:

A) Run all PW and CP tests in serial and show a final report

$ make run-tests

If 'run-tests-parallel', it runs the custom test in parallel (4 MPI)


B) Run the test that is in a single directory and show a final report

$ make run-custom-test testdir=name_of_directory

For example, the following runs only the tests in the pw_spinorbit directory
$ make run-custom-test testdir=pw_spinorbit

If 'run-custom-test-parallel', it runs the specified test in parallel (4 MPI)

$ make run-custom-test-parallel testdir=epw_base

C) Compare the latest run of tests (SERIAL or PARALLEl) and redirect
   the output to various files called "out.XXX.`date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S`" (python 
   buffers both stdout and stderr). 'XXX' is replaced by the name of the
   package (e.g. 'PW')

$ make compare


D) Regenerate all benchmark reference files -- WORKS ONLY IN THE SERIAL MODE

$ make create_reference


E) Clean all test files create so far and leave only benchmark reference

$ make clean



REFERENCE OUTPUTS
-----------------

All reference outputs have been computed using GCC 4.9.2. The following 
configure options have been used:

./configure --disable-openmp --disable-parallel \
    --with-internal-blas --with-internal-lapack


KNOWN ISSUES
------------
pw_vdw/vdw-ts.in fails with ifort v.12.0.2.137 unless Modules/tsvdw.f90 is compiled with -O0
