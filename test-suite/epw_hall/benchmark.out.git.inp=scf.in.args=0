     Parallel version (MPI), running on     4 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     12661 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts
 
     Reading input from scf.in

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4
 
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =       4
     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used

!    total energy              =     -26.52536500 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          9.5E-15 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:
     one-electron contribution =       4.84956395 Ry
     hartree contribution      =       3.75561280 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.79485345 Ry
     ewald contribution        =     -26.33568830 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  29 iterations
