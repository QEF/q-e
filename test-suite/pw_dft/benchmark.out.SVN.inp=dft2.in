     Program PWSCF v.6.1 (svn rev. 13369) starts on  2Mar2017 at 23:43: 1 

     This program is part of the open-source Quantum ESPRESSO suite
     for quantum simulation of materials; please cite
         "P. Giannozzi et al., J. Phys.:Condens. Matter 21 395502 (2009);

     in publications or presentations arising from this work. More details at
     http://www.quantum-espresso.org/quote

     Serial multi-threaded version, running on    4 processor cores
     Reading input from dft2.in

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = REVPBE ( 1  4  4  4 0 0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
