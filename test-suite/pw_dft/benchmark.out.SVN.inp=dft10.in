     Serial multi-threaded version, running on    4 processor cores
     Reading input from dft10.in

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = EV93 ( 1  4 25  0 0 0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
