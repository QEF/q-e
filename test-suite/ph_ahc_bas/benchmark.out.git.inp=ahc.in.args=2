     Parallel version (MPI), running on     1 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     38555 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts
 
     Reading input from ahc1.in

     Reading xml data from directory:

     ./BAs.save/
 
     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used


     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation= PZ
                           (   1   1   0   0   0   0   0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
