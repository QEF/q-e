Electron minimization of CP-WF is protocol-dependent. In this test, `nstep` is
intentionally chosen to be too small to reach full convergence to the ground state.
Doing so increases the sensitivity of the test on the protocol-dependence, which
could be useful in probing inconsistent changes in the MLWF routines.
