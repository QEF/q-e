# This is a test to compare matrix elements produced directly by DFPT inside the PH code
# and matrix elements interpolated by EPW (Rewritten by H. Lee based on the previous version by S. Ponce and C. Verdi)

1) Issue "make" after compiling pw.x and ph.x.

2) Run EPW with prtgkk.

You can compare the results.
