     Serial multi-threaded version, running on    4 processor cores
     Reading input from relax-el.in

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3
     Presently no symmetry can be used with electric field
