     Parallel version (MPI), running on     1 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     4706 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts
 
     Reading input from md_verlet_wall.in
     Reading   1 constraints; tolerance:    0.000001
         1) potential wall at 0 z-axis is requested
         External force is proportional to:
               1.200000 (a.u.) *     1.500000 (a.u.) * exp(   -1.500000).
         Force is applied when atom is within     0.900000 (a.u.) from the wall.

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4
