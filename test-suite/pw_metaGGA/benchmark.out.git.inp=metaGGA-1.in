     Parallel version (MPI), running on     4 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     2487 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts

     Reading input from metaGGA-1.in

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4

     WARNING: the MGGA functional with ID    1 has been 
     read together with other dft terms, but it should 
     stand alone in order to work properly. The other 
     terms will be ignored.
