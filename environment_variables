# environment_variables -- settings for running Quantum ESPRESSO examples

######## YOU MAY NEED TO EDIT THIS FILE TO MATCH YOUR CONFIGURATION ########

# To run the examples, you should follow this procedure:

# 1) Optionally, edit the following variables:

#      BIN_DIR = directory where ESPRESSO executables reside
#      PSEUDO_DIR = directory where pseudopotential files reside
#                   if needed pseudopotentials are not found there,
#                   they will be downloaded from NETWORK_PSEUDO
#      TMP_DIR = directory to be used as temporary storage area
#                Make sure that it is writable by you, that it has
#                enough available space to host the temporary files,
#                preferably offering high I/O performance (i.e.,
#                don't use an NFS-mounted directory), and that
#                it doesn't contain any valuable data:
#                EVERYTHING THERE WILL BE DESTROYED

# The default values set below should be good for most cases 

# 2) For parallel execution, edit the following variables:

#      PARA_PREFIX: prepended to the executable name, typically contains
#                   the launcher program and the number of processors
#      PARA_PREFIX: appended to the executable name, typically contains
#                   parallelization options

#  Example: if you need to run the code as 
#     mpirun -np 4 pw.x -nk 1 < file.in > file.out
#  then PARA_PREFIX="mpirun -np 4", PARA_POSTFIX="-nk 1"

#  For execution with OpenMP or mixed MPI/OpenMP, you may also need to set
#      OMP_NUM_THREADS: number of threads for OpenMP parallelization.

#  For serial execution it should not be needed to specify anything.

#  See section "Running on parallel machines" of the user guide
#  for more details

#  BEWARE: most tests and examples are devised to be run serially or on
#  a small number of processors; do not use tests and examples to benchmark
#  parallelism, do not run on too many processors

# 3) To run a single example, go to the corresponding directory (for
#  instance, "example/example01") and execute:

#    ./run_example

#  This will create a subdirectory "results", containing the input and
#  output files generated by the calculation.
#  If your machine does not support interactive use, you must execute 
#  "run_example" throught the batch queueing system running on that machine.
#  Ask your system administrator for instructions.

#   Some examples take only a few seconds to run, while others may
#   require several minutes depending on your system.

# 4) In each example's directory, the "reference" subdirectory contains
#  verified output files, that you can check your results against.

#  Your results might be slightly different from reference results,
#  in particular if different FFT dimensions are automatically selected.
#  For this reason, a plain "diff" of your results against the reference
#  data may not work and human inspection of the results may be needed.
