# BIN_DIR = path of compiled executables
#     Usually this is $PREFIX/bin, where $PREFIX is the root of the
#     Quantum ESPRESSO source tree.
# PSEUDO_DIR = path of pseudopotentials required by the examples
#     if required pseudopotentials are not found in $PSEUDO_DIR, 
#     example scripts will try to download them from NETWORK_PSEUDO
# TMP_DIR = temporary directory to be used by the examples
#     Make sure that it is writable by you and that it doesn't contain
#     any valuable data (EVERYTHING THERE WILL BE DESTROYED)

# The following should be good for most cases 

PREFIX=`cd ../../.. ; pwd`
BIN_DIR=$PREFIX/bin
PSEUDO_DIR=$PREFIX/pseudo
# Beware: everything in $TMP_DIR will be destroyed !
TMP_DIR=$PREFIX/tempdir

# There should be no need to change anything below this line

# To run the ESPRESSO programs on a parallel machine, you may have to
# add the appropriate commands (poe, mpirun, mpprun...) and/or options
# (specifying number of processors, pools...) before and after the
# executable's name.  That depends on how your machine is configured.
# For example on an IBM SP4:
#
#     poe             pw.x -procs 4              < file.in > file.out
#     ^^^ PARA_PREFIX      ^^^^^^^^ PARA_POSTFIX
#
# To run on a single processor, you can usually leave them empty.
# BEWARE: most tests and examples are devised to be run serially or on
# a small number of processors; do not use tests and examples to benchmark
# parallelism, do not run on too many processors
