        All quantities whose dimensions are not explicitly specified are in
        RYDBERG ATOMIC UNITS. Charge is "number" charge (i.e. not multiplied 
        by e); potentials are in energy units (i.e. they are multiplied by e).
        
        @b BEWARE: TABS, DOS <CR><LF> CHARACTERS ARE POTENTIAL SOURCES OF TROUBLE 

        Namelists must appear in the order given below.
        Comment lines in @i namelists can be introduced by a "!", exactly as in 
        fortran code. Comments lines in @i cards can be introduced by 
        either a "!" or a "#" character in the first position of a line.
        Do not start any line in @i cards with a "/" character.
        Leave a space between card names and card options, e.g.
        ATOMIC_POSITIONS (bohr), not ATOMIC_POSITIONS(bohr)
        Do not start any line in @i cards with a "/" character.

                polarized calculations, unless you constrain the magnetization
                (see @ref tot_magnetization and @ref constrained_magnetization).
                Note that if you start from zero initial magnetization, you 
                will invariably end up in a nonmagnetic (zero magnetization)
                state. If you want to start from an antiferromagnetic state,
                you may need to define two different atomic species
                corresponding to sublattices of the same atomic type.
                starting_magnetization is ignored if you are performing a 
                non-scf calculation, if you are restarting from a previous
                run, or restarting from an interrupted run.
                If you fix the magnetization with @ref tot_magnetization,
                you should not specify starting_magnetization.
                In the spin-orbit case starting with zero 
                starting_magnetization on all atoms imposes time reversal
                symmetry. The magnetization is never calculated and

               This flag is used for isolated atoms (@ref nat=1) together with 
               @ref occupations='from_input'. If it is .TRUE., the wavefunctions 
               are ordered as the atomic starting wavefunctions, independently 
               from their eigenvalue. The occupations indicate which atomic 
               states are filled.
                
               The order of the states is written inside the UPF pseudopotential file.
               In the scalar relativistic case: 
               S -> l=0, m=0

               D -> l=2, r^2-3z^2, xz, yz, xy, x^2-y^2

               In the noncollinear magnetic case (with or without spin-orbit), 
               each group of states is doubled. For instance:
               P -> l=1, z, x, y for spin up, l=1, z, x, y for spin down.
               Up and down is relative to the direction of the starting
               magnetization.
                
               In the case with spin-orbit and time-reversal 
               (@ref starting_magnetization=0.0) the atomic wavefunctions are 
               radial functions multiplied by spin-angle functions.

                    m_j=-3/2, -1/2, 1/2, 3/2.

               In the magnetic case with spin-orbit the atomic wavefunctions
               can be forced to be spin-angle functions by setting
               @ref starting_spin_angle to .TRUE..

               By setting @ref starting_spin_angle=.TRUE. this behaviour can

                    infinite medium in the perpendicular direction

            NB:
                       - The length of the unit-cell along the z direction should
                         be larger than twice the thickness of the 2D material 
                         (including electrons). A reasonable estimate for a 
                         layer's thickness could be the interlayer distance in the 
                         corresponding layered bulk material. Otherwise,  
                         the atomic thickness + 10 bohr should be a safe estimate. 
                         There is also a lower limit of 20 bohr imposed by the cutoff 
                         radius used to read pseudopotentials (see read_pseudo.f90 in Modules).

                       - As for ESM above, only in-plane stresses make sense and one
                         should use cell_dofree='2Dxy' in a vc-relax calculation.

               This keyword is useful when simulating the dynamics and/or the
               thermodynamics of an isolated system. If set to true the total
               torque of the internal forces is set to zero by adding new forces
               that compensate the spurious interaction with the periodic
               images. This allows for the use of smaller supercells.

               BEWARE: since the potential energy is no longer consistent with
               the forces (it still contains the spurious interaction with the
               repeated images), the total energy is not conserved anymore.
               However the dynamical and thermodynamical properties should be
               in closer agreement with those of an isolated system.
               Also the final energy of a structural relaxation will be higher,
               but the relaxation itself should be faster.

                                          is equivalent to
