     atom    2 type  1   force =     0.00000000    0.00000000    0.00000737

     atom    4 type  1   force =     0.00000000    0.00000000    0.00000000
     atom    5 type  1   force =     0.00000000    0.00000000   -0.00007547
     atom    6 type  1   force =     0.00000000    0.00000000   -0.00000737
     atom    7 type  1   force =     0.00000000    0.00000000   -0.00003344

     Total force =     0.000117     Total SCF correction =     0.000122
     SCF correction compared to forces is large: reduce conv_thr to get better values

     bfgs converged in  10 scf cycles and   9 bfgs steps
     (criteria: energy <  1.0E-04, force <  1.0E-03)
