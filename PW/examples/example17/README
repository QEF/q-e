Introduction:
================================
This example continues the demonstration of how to apply the 
orbital-resolved DFT+U method (Macke et al, arXiv:2312.13580 (2023))
using the example of the low-spin transition-metal compound LiCoO2. 

Unlike in the previous example (example15), in the following, we pursue 
a one-step procedure in order to compute the total energy of the PBE+U 
ground state with the Hubbard U manifold being the t_2g orbitals of the Co-3d
shell in LiCoO2. 

!!!!!!!
BEWARE: this prodcedure can only be applied because we know
from previous calculations that the t_2g orbitals correspond to the 3rd, 4th
and 5th eigenvalue of the Co-3d occupation matrix (the ordering is ascending,
i.e. 1st eigenvalue is the least occupied orbital, 5th is most occupied).
If you don't know this order in advance for your system of interest, 
please stick to the two-step procedure shown in example15.
!!!!!!!

================================
Explanation of the input:
================================
Although the desired solution is nonmagnetic, we set nspin=2 for demonstration
purposes. The input file is a regular PBE+U input, except that some integers
follow the value of the Hubbard U parameter (here 5.0eV).
These integers are the eigenvalue indices of the target orbitals and therefore
define the Hubbard manifold. When correcting a d-shell, in the spin-unpolarized 
case (nspin=1), we can target the magnetic quantum orbitals 1 (corresponding
to the least occupied eigenstate) to 5 (the most occupied one).

However, in the collinear spin-polarized case (nspin=2), we can target individual 
spin-orbitals. Here, the integers 1 to 5 are used to select the spin-up
orbitals while 6 to 10 are used to target the spin-down channel's orbitals.
For a p-shell, 1 to 3 would refer to spin-up while 4 to 6 would target the
spin-down spin orbitals.

In this example, we suppose that we know the t_2g orbitals will turn out to
be the three most occupied ones of each spin-channel. Thus, we assign the 
Hubbard U correction to the indices "3 4 5 8 9 10", where the first three 
values target the 3rd, 4th and 5th eigenstate of the spin-up channel while
the latter three target the 3rd (8-5), 4th (9-5) and 5th (10-5) eigenstate
of the spin-down channel.

================================
Analysis of the output:
================================
The output of this calculation is mostly identical to that of example15, 
including the total energy. However, since we are not restarting from a 
converged charge density, the code prints a warning and also switches on
the orbital-resolved Hubbard U corrections only after the 5th iteration 
of the SCF cycle. Here, it prints another warning that reads

     "Switching ON orbital-resolved Hubbard corrections"

This feature was implemented for the one-step procedure so that the eigenstates
(and their eigenvectors) can stabilize to a certain level before the 
orbital-resolved corrections are applied. This is extremely important because 
the default starting guess is a superposition of atomic orbitals, which is often
a terrbile approximation for the true ground state of most systems.
Thus, the initial eigenstates and eigenvalues typically bear no resemblance with
the converged eigenstates.

If we applied orbital-resolved Hubbard corrections from the very beginning to,
say, the 3rd, 4th and 5th eigenstate in the one-step procedure, 
we would target the last three of the following reference eigenstates:

     =================== HUBBARD OCCUPATIONS ===================

     Tr[ns(  1)] (up, down, total) =   5.00000  2.00000  7.00000

       0.000  0.000  0.000  0.000  1.000

We can clearly see that in the spin-up channel all eigenvalues are 1.00, which is far
from the expected result for this system.
However, after 5 SCF iterations, the occupation matrices look like below, and we can
easily distingish between those states with eigenvalues >0.96 (t_2g orbitals)
and those with eigenvalues ~0.43 (e_g orbitals).
