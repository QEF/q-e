This example tests pw.x for the noncollinear/spin-orbit case with DFT+U and Ultrasoft pseudopotentials.

The calculation proceeds as follows:

1) make a self-consistent calculation for bcc-Fe
   (input=Fe.scf_pbe.in, output=Fe.scf_pbe.out).

2) make a band calculation for bcc-Fe
   (input=Fe.band_pbe.in, output=Fe.band_pbe.out).

The values for U and J are set to 2.2 eV and 1.75 eV respectively as obtained by Dr. Matteo Cococcioni [1].
