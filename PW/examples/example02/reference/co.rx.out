     highest occupied level (ev):    -8.3786

!    total energy              =     -43.10976799 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -43.10976799 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          1.0E-10 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -66.74374711 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      34.44998694 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -9.88010666 Ry
     ewald contribution        =      -0.93590116 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in   5 iterations

     Forces acting on atoms (Ry/au):

     atom    1 type  2   force =    -0.00006319    0.00000000    0.00000000
     atom    2 type  1   force =     0.00006319    0.00000000    0.00000000

     Total force =     0.000063     Total SCF correction =     0.000008
     SCF correction compared to forces is large: reduce conv_thr to get better values

     bfgs converged in   5 scf cycles and   3 bfgs steps
     (criteria: energy <  1.0E-04, force <  1.0E-03)
