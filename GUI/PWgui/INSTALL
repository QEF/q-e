*** INSTALLATION instructions for PWgui ***
________________________________________________________________________


The PWgui package comes in two flavors: 

   (i)  SOURCE PACKAGE

   (ii) STANDALONE EXECUTABLE, which runs out of the box (but works
	only on the platform for which it has been built)

N.B.: for the usage of repository version of PWgui see the
INSTALL.repository file

(i) Installation instructions for SOURCE PACKAGE
________________________________________________________________________

To use the source package you need the required Tcl software, in
particular Tcl + Tk + Itcl + Itk + Iwidgets. PWgui requires the Tcl/Tk
version 8.4 or later. You may install the software from your OS
distribution.

For example, for GNU/Linux Debian-based distributions, execute as root
(or sudo):

   * apt-get update; apt-get install iwidgets4 

(this will install also tcl/tk/itcl/itk, because iwidgets depend on them).
On fedora-based distributions, the analogous command is "dnf". Hence:

   * dnf install iwidgets

Once your computer has all the needed software, your source package is
ready to run. You only need to untar the PWgui source tarball, i.e.:

   * tar zxvf  PWgui-<version>.tgz
or
   * gunzip -c PWgui-<version>.tgz | tar xvf -

where <version> stands for version number. To launch the PWgui
program, type: pwgui. 

You may either add the PWgui root directory to your PATH or create a
link to pwgui launcher from some directory that is on the PATH.

If you would like to copy "pwgui" launcher (but it is more convenient
to make a link instead, see above) to some common place, such as
/usr/local/bin or /opt/bin, then you need to define the PWGUI
environmental variable so that "pwgui" will be able to locate its root
directory (i.e. source files).
