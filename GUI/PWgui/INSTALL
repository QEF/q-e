*** INSTALLATION instructions for PWgui ***
________________________________________________________________________


The PWgui package comes in two flavors: 

   (i)  SOURCE PACKAGE

   (ii) STANDALONE EXECUTABLE, which runs out of the box (but works
	only on the platform for which it was built)

For the usage of the git repository version of PWgui, see the
INSTALL.repository file

(i) Installation instructions for SOURCE PACKAGE
________________________________________________________________________

The following Tcl/Tk packages are required to run PWgui: Tcl, Tk,
Itcl, Itk, and Iwidgets. The Tcl/Tk version 8.4 or later is
required. 

For GNU/Linux Debian-based distributions, these packages can be installed as:

   * sudo apt update; sudo apt install iwidgets4 

On Fedora-based distributions, the analogous command is "dnf", i.e.:

   * sudo dnf update; sudo dnf install iwidgets

This will also install tcl/tk/itcl/itk because iwidgets depend on them.

Once these packages are installed, the PWgui source package is ready
to run. Untar the PWgui source tarball, i.e.:

   * tar zxvf  PWgui-VERSION.tgz

where VERSION stands for version number. To launch the PWgui program,
type: pwgui.

You may either add the PWgui root directory to your PATH or create a
link to the pwgui executable from some directory that is on the PATH.
