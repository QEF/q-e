 ==============================================================================

This is the PWgui---a GUI for the PWscf set of programs within the
open-source Quantum ESPRESSO suite for quantum simulation of materials
(see http://www.quantum-espresso.org).

PWgui is written in [incr Tcl], an extension of Tcl scripting
language, implying that compilation is not needed. However, it depends
on the [incr Tcl] and related software. Therefore, there are two
possibilities:

   (i)  to use a source package (requires the Tcl software, see the
        'INSTALL' file)

   (ii) to use a standalone executable which runs out of the box. It
	works only on the platforms for which it was built. The
	executables are available at http://www-k3.ijs.si/kokalj/pwgui


CURRENT STATUS
--------------

The main purpose of PWgui is to facilitate the creation and
manipulation (editing) of input files for Quantum ESPRESSO programs.
It also provides a syntax checker and an input file formatter
(i.e. pwgui --reformat PROGRAM INPUT).

It is possible to run the supported QE programs by using the GUI. This
feature requires setting the path of the QE executables via the
"File-->Settings" menu (tab: PWscf settings).

PWgui can also use the XCRYSDEN program (http://www.xcrysden.org/) for
the visualization of atomic structures from the pw.x input/output
files or for the visualization of properties calculated via the
sequence: pw.x-->pp.x (when the property was saved into an XSF file).

Currently, the following QE programs (modules) are supported: 
 * pw.x
 * neb.x
 * ph.x
 * pp.x
 * projwfc.x
 * bands.x
 * dos.x
 * ld1.x (atomic)
 * hp.x

NOTE ABOUT THE STANDALONE EXECUTABLES
-------------------------------------

Standalone executables are build using the Starkit's SDX
utility. These executables are starkits---a STAandalone Runtime
tclKITs (http://www.equi4.com/starkit.html). The Tclkit license is the
following:

"Tclkit is a combination of Tcl/Tk, IncrTcl, TclVFS, Zlib, and
 Metakit. Metakit is open source, using an X/MIT-style license. Tcl/Tk,
 IncrTcl, TclVFS, and Zlib have their own, BSD-ish open source
 licenses, so in my understanding this code can be used freely, also
 commercially.

 When Tclkit is distributed as part of a commercial package, copyright
 attributions and license terms for the above need to be included in
 the distribution.

 A reference to the origin of Tclkit is appreciated but not required."
