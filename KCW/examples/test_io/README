This is to test the different KCW IO schema. In practice if the 
periodic part of the wannier orbital densities are read/written in 
G-space (default) or real-space, and if these quantities are 
read/written in double-precision (default) or single-precision.

controlling variable:
io_real_space
io_sp

For each example in the examples folder above 4 different calculations
are run with all possible IO schema:
     io_real_space    io_sp 
          F             F (default since  Feb. 2024) 
          F             T
          T             F (default before Feb. 2024) 
          T             T

Each calculation is compared against the reference folder
of the corresponding example in the "examples" folder.
