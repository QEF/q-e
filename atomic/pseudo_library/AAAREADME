This library collects inputs for the atomic code ld1.x.
The pseudopotentials are separated into four directories:

LDA/REL contains fully relativistic LDA pseudopotentials.
LDA/SR  contains scalar relativistic LDA pseudopotentials.
PBE/REL contains fully relativistic PBE-GGA pseudopotentials.
PBE/SR  contains scalar relativistic PBE-GGA pseudopotentials.

Some of these inputs have been used to generate the pseudopotentials
distributed with QUANTUM-ESPRESSO, others have been written 
recently and need extensive tests. Please help to improve this
library by testing these pseudopotentials, reporting strange or 
unexpected results, or by adding missing pseudopotentials.

These pseudopotentials are not optimized for systems under pressure.
For systems with short bonds you may try to decrease the core radii.
The pseudopotentials are not optimized with respect to the cut-off
energy. Often you can create smoother pseudopotentials by increasing the
core radii. The suggested cut-off for the kinetic energy is indicated in 
the pseudopotential file. Note that this is intended as a high accuracy
cut-off, often a smaller cut-off will suffice.

Be careful, this library is still experimental.
