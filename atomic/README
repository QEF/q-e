This is the distribution of the "atomic"  code for electronic structure 
atomic calculations and pseudo-potentials generation.

The "atomic"  code, maintained by Andrea Dal Corso (SISSA, Trieste) 
is the result of several additions to the original ld1 code by
P. Giannozzi (http://www.fisica.uniud.it/~giannozz/software.html) 
for pseudopotential generation. The major additions are:

a) Generation and test of norm-conserving and ultrasoft pseudo-potentials
   with the Rappe-Rabe-Kaxiras-Joannopoulos (RRKJ) recipe
   ( Phys. Rev. B41, 1227 (1990); Phys. Rev. B 44, 13175 (1991) )
b) Generation of fully relativistic pseudo-potentials including 
   spin-orbit coupling.
c) Generation of PAW dataset. Based on the original implementation by 
   G. Fratesi with several additions by R. Mazzarello and L. Paulatto.

A general introduction on (norm-conserving) pseudopotential generation
can be found in file pseudo-gen.pdf (LaTex source in pseudo-gen.tex). 
Input variables are described in files INPUT_LD1.txt, INPUT_LD1.html
in the directory Doc/ of the Quantum ESPRESSO distribution.
Directories all-electron/, pseudo-gen/, pseudo-test/,
contain tests for the three modes of operation, respectively:
all-electron run, pseudo-potential generation, pseudo-potential testing. 
Directories pseudo_library/ and paw_library/ contain input data used 
for pseudopotential generation of many elements.
A more extended set of input data is now available from the
pslibrary project. Please see the web pages pslibrary.quantum-espresso.org
or dalcorso.github.io/pslibrary/.
