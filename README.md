This is the distribution of the Quantum ESPRESSO suite of codes (ESPRESSO:
opEn-Source Package for Research in Electronic Structure, Simulation, and
Optimization)

## USAGE
Quick installation instructions for CPU-based machines. For GPU execution, see
file [README_GPU.md](README_GPU.md). Go to the directory where this file is. 

Using "make"
(`[]` means "optional"):
```
./configure [options]
make all
```
"make" alone prints a list of acceptable targets. Optionally,
`make -jN` runs parallel compilation on `N` processors.
Link to binaries are found in bin/.

Using "CMake" (v.3.14 or later):

```
mkdir ./build
cd ./build
cmake -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=mpif90 -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpicc [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install] ..
make [-jN]
[make install]
```
Although CMake has the capability to guess compilers, it is strongly recommended to specify
the intended compilers or MPI compiler wrappers as `CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER` and `CMAKE_C_COMPILER`.
"make" builds all targets. Link to binaries are found in build/bin.
If `make install` is invoked, directory `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`
is prepended onto all install directories.

For more information, see the general documentation in directory Doc/, 
package-specific documentation in \*/Doc/, and the web site 
http://www.quantum-espresso.org/. Technical documentation for users and
developers 
can be found on [Wiki page on gitlab](https://gitlab.com/QEF/q-e/-/wikis/home).

## Modular libraries
The following libraries have been isolated and partially encapsulated in view of their release for usage in other codes as well:

- UtilXlib: performing basic MPI handling, error handling, timing handling.
- FFTXlib: parallel (MPI and OpenMP) distributed three-dimensional FFTs, performing also load-balanced distribution of data (plane waves, G-vectors and real-space grids) across processors.
- LAXlib: parallel distributed dense-matrix diagonalization, using ELPA, SCALapack, or a custom algorithm.
- KS Solvers: parallel iterative diagonalization for the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian (represented as an operator),using block Davidson and band-by-band or block Conjugate-Gradient algorithms.
- LRlib: performs a variety of tasks connected with (time-dependent) DFPT, to be used also in connection with Many-Body Perturbation Theory.
- upflib: pseudopotential-related code.
- devXlib: low-level utilities for GPU execution
