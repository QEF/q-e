        General input file structure:
        ===============================================================================
        
        neb.x DOES NOT READ FROM STANDARD INPUT
        
        There are two ways for running a calculation with neb.x:
        
        (1) specifying a file to parse with the ./neb.x -inp or ./neb.x -input
            command line option.
    
        (2) or specifying the number of copies of PWscf input ./neb.x -input_images. 

        For case (1) a file containing special KEYWORDS (aka SUPERCARDS) has to be
        written (see below). These KEYWORDS tells the parser which part of the file
        contains neb specifics and which part contains the energy/force engine input
        (at the moment only PW). After the parsing, different files are generated:
        neb.dat, with neb specific variables and a set of pw_*.in PWscf input files,
        i.e., one for each input position. All options for a single SCF calculation
        apply.

        The general structure of the file to be parsed is:

        BEGIN
          BEGIN_PATH_INPUT
            ... neb specific namelists and cards
          END_PATH_INPUT

          BEGIN_ENGINE_INPUT
            ...pw specific namelists and cards
            BEGIN_POSITIONS
              FIRST_IMAGE
              ...pw ATOMIC_POSITIONS card
              INTERMEDIATE_IMAGE
              ...pw ATOMIC_POSITIONS card
              LAST_IMAGE
              ...pw ATOMIC_POSITIONS card
            END_POSITIONS
            ... other pw specific cards
          END_ENGINE_INPUT
        END

        For case (2) neb.dat and all pw_1.in, pw_2.in ... should be already present.
