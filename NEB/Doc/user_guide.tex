\section{Introduction}

This guide covers the usage of \NEB, version \version: 
an open-source package for the calculation of energy barriers 
and reaction pathway using the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method.

This guide assumes that you know the physics 
that \NEB\ describes and the methods it implements.
It also assumes  that you have already installed,
or know how to install, \qe. If not, please read
the general User's Guide for \qe, found in 
directory \texttt{Doc/} two levels above the 
one containing this guide; or consult the web site:\\
\texttt{http://www.quantum-espresso.org}.

\NEB \ is part of the \qe \ distribution and uses the \PWscf\
package as electronic-structure computing tools (``engine''). 
It is however written in a modular way and could be adapted 
to use other codes as ``engine''. Note that since v.4.3 \PWscf\ no 
longer performs NEB calculations. Also note that NEB with 
Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics is not implemented since v.4.3.

\section{People and terms of use}
The current maintainers of \NEB\ are Layla Martin-Samos,
Paolo Giannozzi, Stefano de Gironcoli.
The original \qe \ implementation of NEB was written 
by Carlo Sbraccia.

\section{Compilation}

\NEB\ is a package tightly bound to \qe.
For instruction on how to download and compile \qe, please refer 
to the general Users' Guide, available in file \texttt{Doc/user\_guide.pdf}
under the main \qe\ directory, or in web site 
\texttt{http://www.quantum-espresso.org}.

Once \qe\ is correctly configured, \NEB\ can be automatically 
downloaded, unpacked and compiled by
just typing \texttt{make neb}, from the main \qe\ directory.
\texttt{make neb} will produce 
the following codes in \texttt{NEB/src}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \nebx: calculates reaction barriers and pathways using NEB.
\item \texttt{path\_int.x}: used by utility \texttt{path\_int.sh}
  that generates, starting from a path (a set of images), a new one with a 
  different number of images. The initial and final points of the new
 path can differ from those in the original one. 
\end{itemize}

Symlinks to executable programs will be placed in the
\texttt{bin/} subdirectory of the main \qe\  directory.

\subsection{Running examples}
\label{SubSec:Examples}
As a final check that compilation was successful, you may want to run some or
all of the examples. To run the examples, you should follow this procedure:
\begin{enumerate}   
\item Go to the \texttt{examples/} directory from the main \qe \ directory and edit the 
  \texttt{environment\_variables} file, setting the following variables as needed: 
\begin{quote}
   BIN\_DIR: directory where executables reside\\
   PSEUDO\_DIR: directory where pseudopotential files reside\\
   TMP\_DIR: directory to be used as temporary storage area
\end{quote}
\end{enumerate}
The default values of BIN\_DIR and PSEUDO\_DIR should be fine, 
unless you have installed things in nonstandard places. TMP\_DIR 
must be a directory where you have read and write access to, with 
enough available space to host the temporary files produced by the 
example runs, and possibly offering high I/O performance (i.e., don't 
use an NFS-mounted directory). NOTA BENE: do not use a
directory containing other data, the examples will clean it!
If you have compiled the parallel version of \qe\ (this
is the default if parallel libraries are detected), you will usually
have to specify a driver program (such as \texttt{mpirun} or \texttt{mpiexec}) 
and the number of processors: see Sec.\ref{SubSec:para} for
details. In order to do that, edit again the \texttt{environment\_variables} 
file
and set the PARA\_PREFIX and PARA\_POSTFIX variables as needed. 
Parallel executables will be run by a command like this: 
\begin{verbatim}
      $PARA_PREFIX neb.x $PARA_POSTFIX -inp file.in > file.out
\end{verbatim}
For example, if the command line is like this (as for an IBM SP):
\begin{verbatim}
      poe neb.x -procs 4 -inp file.in > file.out
\end{verbatim}
you should set PARA\_PREFIX="poe", PARA\_POSTFIX="-procs
4". Furthermore, if your machine does not support interactive use, you
must run the commands specified below through the batch queuing
system installed on that machine. Ask your system administrator for
instructions. 

Go to NEB/examples and execute:
\begin{verbatim}
      ./run_example
\end{verbatim}
This will create a subdirectory results, containing the input and
output files generated by the calculation.

The \texttt{reference/} subdirectory contains
verified output files, that you can check your results against. They
were generated on a Linux PC using the Intel compiler. On different
architectures the precise numbers could be slightly different, in
particular if different FFT dimensions are automatically selected. For
this reason, a plain diff of your results against the reference data
doesn't work, or at least, it requires human inspection of the
results. 

\section{Parallelism}
\label{Sec:para}

\NEB \ uses \PWscf\ as energy and forces engine. It can take advantage from the two 
different parallelization paradigms currently implemented inside \qe. For a detailed
information about \qe \ parallization, please refer to the \qe \ general documentation.
All \PWscf-specific parallelization options holds.

As \NEB \ makes several energy and forces evaluations ("images") for each NEB cycle 
it is possible to distribute them through 
Message-Passing (MPI).

\subsection{Running on parallel machines}
\label{SubSec:para}

Parallel execution is strongly system- and installation-dependent. 
Typically one has to specify:
\begin{enumerate}
\item a launcher program (not always needed), 
such as \texttt{poe}, \texttt{mpirun}, \texttt{mpiexec},
  with the  appropriate options (if any);
\item the number of processors, typically as an option to the launcher
  program, but in some cases to be specified after the name of the
  program to be
  executed; 
\item the program to be executed, with the proper path if needed: for
  instance, \texttt{./neb.x}, or \texttt{\$HOME/bin/neb.x}, or
  whatever applies; 
\item other \texttt{PWscf}-specific parallelization options, to be
  read and interpreted by the running code; 
\item the number of ``images'' used by NEB.
\end{enumerate}
Items 1) and 2) are machine- and installation-dependent, and may be 
different for interactive and batch execution. Note that large
parallel machines are  often configured so as to disallow interactive
execution: if in doubt, ask your system administrator.
Item 3) also depend on your specific configuration (shell, execution
path, etc). 
Item 4) is optional but may be important: see the following section
for the meaning of the various options.

For illustration, here is how to run \texttt{neb.x} \ on 16 processors partitioned into
4 images (4 processors each), for a path containing at least 4 points.

IBM SP machines, batch:
\begin{verbatim}
   neb.x -nimages 4 -inp input
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Parallelization levels}

Data structures are distributed across processors.
Processors are organized in a hierarchy of groups, 
which are identified by different MPI communicators level.
The groups hierarchy is as follow:
\begin{verbatim}
  world - images - PWscf hierarchy
\end{verbatim}

{\bf world}: is the group of all processors (MPI\_COMM\_WORLD).

{\bf images}: Processors can then be divided into different "images",
corresponding to a point in configuration space (i.e. to
a different set of atomic positions).

{\bf Communications}:
Images is loosely coupled and processors communicate
between different images only once in a while, whereas
processors within each image are tightly coupled and communications
are significant. 

Default value is: \texttt{-nimage 1} ;

\section{Using \NEB}

{\bf Reminder 1:} NEB calculations are no longer performed by \pwx.
In order to perform a NEB calculation, you should compile
\texttt{NEB/src/neb.x} (command \texttt{make neb} from the main
\qe\ directory, or commend \texttt{make} from the \texttt{NEB} directory). 

\noindent {\bf  Reminder 2:} \nebx\ does not read from standard input.
You cannot use input redirection, as in \texttt{neb.x < neb.in ...}.

A NEB calculation can be run in two different ways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item by reading a single input file, to be specified using command-line 
options \texttt{neb.x -inp} or \texttt{neb.x -input};
\item by specifying the number $N$ of images (i.e. points in the 
configuration space), using command-line option 
\texttt{neb.x -input\_images N}, and providing input data in 
a \texttt{neb.dat} file and in files \texttt{pw\_X.in}, $X=1,...,N$.
\end{enumerate}

For case 1) the input file contains KEYWORDS (see below for format 
specifications). 
These KEYWORDS enable the code to distinguish which part of the file 
contains NEB-specific data and which parts contains input data for the
energy and force computational engine (currently only PW).
After the parsing, different files are generated: \texttt{neb.dat}, with
NEB-specific input data, and a set of PWscf input files 
\texttt{pw\_1.in},..,\texttt{pw\_N.in} PWscf input files, one for each
set of atomic position. All options for a single SCF calculation apply.

The general structure of the file to be parsed is:

\begin{verbatim}
BEGIN
BEGIN_PATH_INPUT
~... neb specific namelists and cards
END_PATH_INPUT
BEGIN_ENGINE_INPUT
BEGIN_ENGINE_INPUT
~...pw specific namelists and cards
BEGIN_POSITIONS
FIRST_IMAGE
~...pw ATOMIC_POSITIONS card
INTERMEDIATE_IMAGE
~...pw ATOMIC_POSITIONS card
LAST_IMAGE
~...pw ATOMIC_POSITIONS card
END_POSITIONS
~... other pw specific cards
END_ENGINE_INPUT
END
\end{verbatim}

For case 2), the \texttt{neb.dat} file and all \texttt{pw\_X.in} 
should be already present. 

A detailed description of all NEB-specific input variables 
is contained in files \texttt{Doc/INPUT\_NEB.*}. See Example 17. 

A NEB calculation will produce a number of files in the current directory
(i.e. in the directory were the code is run) containing additional information
on the minimum-energy path. The files are organized as following
(where \texttt{prefix} is specified in the input file):
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{prefix.dat}]
is a three-column file containing the position of each image on the reaction
coordinate (arb. units), its energy in eV relative to the energy of the first image
and the residual error for the image in eV/$a_0$.
\item[\texttt{prefix.int}]
contains an interpolation of the path energy profile that pass exactly through each
image; it is computed using both the image energies and their derivatives
\item[\texttt{prefix.path}]
information used by \qe\ 
to restart a path calculation, its format depends on the input
details and is undocumented
\item[\texttt{prefix.axsf}]
atomic positions of all path images in the XCrySDen animation format:
to visualize it, use \texttt{xcrysden -\--axsf prefix.axsf}
\item[\texttt{prefix.xyz}]
atomic positions of all path images in the generic xyz format, used by
many quantum-chemistry softwares
\item[\texttt{prefix.crd}]
path information in the input format used by \pwx, suitable for a manual
restart of the calculation
\end{description}

"NEB calculation are a bit tricky in general and require extreme care to be
setup correctly. NEB also takes easily hundreds of iteration to converge,
of course depending on the number of atoms and of images. Here is some
free advice:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Don't use Climbing Image (CI) from the beginning. It makes convergence slower, 
especially if the special image changes during the convergence process (this 
may happen if \texttt{CI\_scheme='auto'} and if it does it may mess up everything).
Converge your calculation, then restart from the last configuration with
CI option enabled (note that this will {\em increase} the barrier).
\item
Carefully choose the initial path. Remember that \qe\ assumes continuity
between the first and the last image at the initial condition. In other 
words, periodic images are NOT used; you may have to manually translate
an atom by one or more unit cell base vectors in order to have a meaningful
initial path. You can visualize NEB input files with XCrySDen as animations,
take some time to check if any atoms overlap or get very close in the initial
path (you will have to add intermediate images, in this case).
\item
Try to start the NEB process with most atomic positions fixed, 
in order to converge the more "problematic" ones, before leaving
all atoms move.
\item
Especially for larger systems, you can start NEB with lower accuracy 
(less k-points, lower cutoff) and then increase it when it has
converged to refine your calculation.
\item
Use the Broyden algorithm instead of the default one: it is a bit more
fragile, but it removes the problem of "oscillations" in the calculated
activation energies. If these oscillations persist, and you cannot afford 
more images, focus to a smaller problem, decompose it into pieces.
\item
A gross estimate of the required number of iterations is
(number of images) * (number of atoms) * 3. Atoms that do not
move should not be counted. It may take half that many iterations, 
or twice as many, but more or less that's the order of magnitude, 
unless one starts from a very good or very bad initial guess.
\end{enumerate}

The code \texttt{path\_int.x} is
is a tool to generate a new path (what is actually
generated is the restart file) starting from an old one through
interpolation (cubic splines). The new path can be discretized with a
different number of images (this is its main purpose), images are
equispaced and the interpolation can be also
performed on a subsection of the old path. The input file needed by
\texttt{path\_int.x} can be easily set up  with the help of the self-explanatory
\texttt{path\_int.sh} shell script.


\section{Performances}

\NEB \ requires roughly the time and memory 
needed for a single SCF calculation, times
\texttt{num\_of\_images}, times the number 
of NEB iterations needed to reach convergence.
We
refer the reader to the PW user\_guide for more information.

\section{Troubleshooting}

Almost all problems in \NEB \ arise from incorrect input data 
and result in
error stops. Error messages should be self-explanatory, but unfortunately
this is not always true. If the code issues a warning messages and continues,
pay attention to it but do not assume that something is necessarily wrong in
your calculation: most warning messages signal harmless problems.
