Archive contains the tarballs of external libraries and codes used by "make"
to build QE. Note that "CMake" stores such packages in external/ instead.
In the future, these files should be removed or replaced as follows:

- fox.tgz		fetch from git repository
- lapack-3.6.1.tgz	fetch from git repository
- libbeef-0.1.2.tar.gz	move to XClib directory
- libmbd-0.10.3.tar.gz fetch from git repository
- libmbd-0.10.3-non-cmake-makefiles.tar.gz (patches for libmbd-0.10.3.tar.gz to add non-cmake support)
