These are instructions on how to run some or all of the examples
contained within the "examples" directory of the ESPRESSO
distribution (the one where this file should be).  Those examples try
to exercise all the programs and features of the ESPRESSO package: for
details, see the "README" file in each example's directory.
If you find that any relevant feature isn't being tested, please
contact us (or even better, write and send us a new example
yourself!).

If you haven't downloaded the full ESPRESSO distribution and don't
have the examples, you can get them from the Test and Examples Page of
the ESPRESSO web site (http://www.pwscf.org/tests.htm).  The necessary
pseudopotentials are included.

To run the examples, you should follow this procedure:

1) Go to the "examples" directory and edit the "environment_variables"
   file, setting the following variables as needed:

     BIN_DIR = directory where ESPRESSO executables reside
     PSEUDO_DIR = directory where pseudopotential files reside
     TMP_DIR = directory to be used as temporary storage area

   If you have downloaded the full ESPRESSO distribution, you may set
   BIN_DIR=$TOPDIR/bin and PSEUDO_DIR=$TOPDIR/pseudo, where $TOPDIR is
   the root of the ESPRESSO source tree.

   The PSEUDO_DIR directory must contain the following files:

     Al.vbc.UPF, As.gon.UPF, C.pz-rrkjus.UPF, Cu.pz-d-rrkjus.UPF,
     Fe.pz-nd-rrkjus.UPF, H.fpmd.UPF, H.vbc.UPF, N.BLYP.UPF,
     Ni.pbe-nd-rrkjus.UPF, NiUS.RRKJ3.UPF, O.BLYP.UPF,
     O.LDA.US.RRKJ3.UPF, O.pbe-rrkjus.UPF, O.vdb.UPF, OPBE_nc.UPF,
     Pb.vdb.UPF, Ptrel.RRKJ3.UPF, Si.vbc.UPF, SiPBE_nc.UPF, Ti.vdb.UPF
     Si.pbe-rrkjus.UPF

   If any of these are missing, you may not be able to run some of the
   examples.  You can download them from the Pseudopotentials Page of
   the ESPRESSO web site (http://www.pwscf.org/pseudo.htm).

   TMP_DIR must be a directory you have read and write access to, with
   enough available space to host the temporary files produced by the
   example runs, and possibly offering high I/O performance (i.e.,
   don't use an NFS-mounted directory).

2) If you have compiled the parallel version of ESPRESSO (that is the
   default), you'll usually have to specify a driver program (such as
   "poe" or "mpiexec") and the number of processors: see the section
   ``Running on parallel machines'' of the ESPRESSO manual for
   details.

   In order to do that, edit again the "environment_variables" file
   and set the PARA_PREFIX and PARA_POSTFIX variables as needed.
   Parallel executables will be run by a command like this:

     $PARA_PREFIX pw.x $PARA_POSTFIX < file.in > file.out

   For example, if the command line is like this (as for an IBM SP4):

     poe pw.x -procs 4 < file.in > file.out

   you should set PARA_PREFIX="poe", PARA_POSTFIX="-procs 4".

   Furthermore, if your machine does not support interactive use, you
   must run the commands specified below through the batch queueing
   system installed on that machine.  Ask your system administrator
   for instructions.

3) To run a single example, go to the corresponding directory (for
   instance, "example/example01") and execute:

     ./run_example

   (for examples 21 and 26, see their description below)
   This will create a subdirectory "results", containing the input and
   output files generated by the calculation.

   Some examples take only a few seconds to run, while others may
   require several minutes depending on your system.

   To run all the examples in one go, execute:

     ./run_all_examples

   from the "examples" directory.  On a single-processor machine, this
   typically takes one to three hours.

   The "make_clean" script cleans the examples tree, by removing all
   the "results" subdirectories.  However, if additional
   subdirectories have been created, they aren't deleted.

4) In each example's directory, the "reference" subdirectory contains
   verified output files, that you can check your results against.

   The reference results were generated on a Linux PC with Intel compiler.
   On different architectures the precise numbers could be slightly
   different, in particular if different FFT dimensions are
   automatically selected.  For this reason, a plain "diff" of your
   results against the reference data doesn't work, or at least, it 
   requires human inspection of the results.

   Instead, you can run the "check_example" script in the "examples"
   directory:

     ./check_example example_dir

   where "example_dir" is the directory of the example that you want
   to check (e.g., "./check_example example01").  You can specify
   multiple directories.

   Note: at the moment "check_example" is in early development and
   (should be) guaranteed to work only on examples 01 to 04.
