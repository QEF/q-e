-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The theoretical approach on which XSpectra is based was
described in:

pseudopotentials scheme: from $\alpha$-quartz to high-T$_c$ compounds",

You should cite these three works in all publications using this software.

The implementation of the DFT+U approximation and its application to
K-edge XAS in NiO was performed in:

C. Gougoussis, M. Calandra, A. Seitsonen, Ch. Brouder, A. Shukla, F. Mauri
" Intrinsic charge transfer gap in NiO from  Ni K -edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy",
Phys. Rev. B 79, 045118 (2009)

If you use DFT+U, you should cite this work too.

Finally you should cite properly the Quantum ESPRESSO distribution.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
XSpectra is a post-processing tools that relies on the output 
(the charge density) of the PWscf code (pw.x). 
Thus a scf calculation needs to be done before running 
xspectra.x.

To simulate core-hole effects, a pseudopotential with a hole in the s
state (1s for K-edges, 2s for L1-edges, 2p1/2 for L2-edges, 2p3/2 for
L3-edges) needs to be generated for the absorbing atom. 
Some of these pseudopotentials are available 
in the XSpectra examples directory, some others are available on 
the pseudopotential web-page at www.quantum-espresso.org/ with the
label "*star1s*_gipaw*" for K-edges, "*star2s*_gipaw*" for L1-edges and so on. 

The self-consistent calculation is then performed on a supercell including
the absorbing atom. The size of the supercell needs to be verified from
system to system, since fairly large supercells are necessary for convergence.
If core-hole effects need not to be taken into account then a calculation on
a single cell with a standard pseudopotential (i.e. without the core-hole) 
is enough. 

Since xspectra.x uses GIPAW reconstruction of the all electron wavefunction
the pseudopotential needs to contain information about GIPAW reconstruction.
There is no limit to the number of GIPAW projector that can be included. 
Note however that at least two projectors are needed to obtain XAS spectra
converged up to 30-40 eV from the Fermi level.
The use of a single projector is discouraged, particularly when semicore
states are present. If more than two projectors are used, linear independence
of the projectors should be explicitly verified (verbosity='high'). 

Once the scf charge density has been obtained, the xspectra.x code can be 
used as a post-processing tool. Note that the X-ray absorption spectra
can be calculated on a larger mesh, different from that used in the 
PWscf scf run. Convergence need to be tested also for this second mesh.
XSpectra calculates then the XAS electric dipole (for K and L edges)
or electric quadrupole contributions (for K and L1 edges only),
using the Lanczos method and the continued fraction.
This approach does not require the explicit calculation of empty states
and it is consequently very fast (only the charge density is needed).
The code needs the radial core wavefunction of the initial core state
in input. This wavefunction is included in the pseudo
and can be extracted using the script upf2plotcore.sh
in the directory ~/espresso/XSpectra/tools/ .
Note that this script works only for UPF version 1.
This is necessary to calculate the XAS matrix element.

The output spectrum can be separated in its spin-up and 
spin-down polarizations.
DFT+U calculations  and collinear magnetism are possible.
Ultrasoft pseudopotentials are allowed.
Hybrid functionals not yet allowed.

 In order to cut the occupied states, the program performs an integration
 over the variable t in ] 0, infinity [. 
 For more details see ref. 
  Ch. Brouder, M. Alouani, K. H. Bennemann, Phys. Rev. B 54 (1996) p.7334-49.
 The integration is done with t going in two opposite directions, 
 from the start value cut_startt. So, the integration
 is done over ]cut_tinf,cut_startt] at least with step cut_stepl, and
 over [cut_startt,cut_tsup[ at least with step cut_stepu. 
 There are two arrays of size cut_nmeml and cut_nmemu 
 in order to save Green functions values. There is an area near
 the Fermi level of size cut_desmooth (in eV) where the cross section 
 is interpolated in order to avoid a divergence.
