 MOLECULARNEXAFS

 This code combines the output of different codes (pw.x, projwfc.x,
 and mainly xspectra.x) to evaluate the NEXAFS spectrum of a molecule
 containing inequivalent atoms belonging to the same species.

 The theoretical framework adopted is explained in the following
 publication, which should be cited in papers using this tool
 (additionally to relevant papers for the NEXAFS calculation):

 The spectrum for each inequivalent atom of the same species sums up
 into a total spectrum, where the contributions from each atom (as
 evaluated by xspectra.x) have to be properly aligned before the
 summation. For example, a molecule like pyridine contains C atoms in
 three different sites, C1, C2, and C3. This example is adopted below.

 For each inequivalent atom in the molecule, the code requires:

 1) A full-core-hole (FCH) calculation of the total energy by pw.x
    (by a FCH pseudopotential at C_i). The code will return the
    core-level shifts (CLS) as a by-product.

 2) Half-core-hole (HCH) calculations of the NEXAFS spectrum by
    xspectra.x for the three directions X-Y-Z.  Those will be read as
    prefix(iat)//suffix(idir)

 3) Since xspectra.x energy scales may not refer to the vacuum level
    (more commonly the Fermi level or the middle of the HOMO-LUMO gap
    may have been used), one also need to input the reference energy
    level of the HCH xspectra.x calculation, and the corresponding
    vacuum level.

    The vacuum level might be estimated by the Makov-Payne correction
    directly in the HCH pw.x SCF calculation if the unit cell is
    cubic, or by running additional calculations accessing the vacuum
    level, then by evaluating the vacuum-to-HOMO energy difference in
    this case, summed to the HOMO of the original calculation.

    For adsorbed molecules, one should refer to the Fermi level both
    for NEXAFS and the XPS, as is generally done in the experiments.
    So we should set both evacuum=0 and efermi=0, and the new zero
    will be the average core level binding energy with respect to the
    Fermi level.

 4) Eventually, energies from xspectra.x output files will be shifted
    (E->E+eshift) so that the new zero of energy is the weighted
    average of core-level binding energies:

       eshift(iat)= -(evacuum(iat)-efermi(iat)) + dcorebe(iat)

    where the first term sets the vacuum level at zero and the second
    one adds to the transition energy the core level shift.

    Recall that by the pseudopotential approach binding energies are
    defined only up to a constant.

 5) Optionally, the PDOS of p symmetry can be taken as an approximation
    to the spectrum for a K edge: the comparison is useful for checking
    the results.
