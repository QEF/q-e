The theoretical approach on which XSpectra is based was
described in:

L23 edges,

O. Bunau and M. Calandra
Projector augmented wave calculation of x-ray absorption spectra at the L2,3 edges
Phys. Rev. B 87, 205105 (2013) 

K edges

Christos Gougoussis, Matteo Calandra, Ari P. Seitsonen, Francesco Mauri,
"First principles calculations of X-ray absorption in an ultrasoft
pseudopotentials scheme: from $\alpha$-quartz to high-T$_c$ compounds",
Phys. Rev. B 80, 075102 (2009)

you should cite this work in all publications using this software.

If you use only Norm Conserving pseudopotentials, you should also
cite the following publication:

M. Taillefumier, D. Cabaret, A. M. Flank, and F. Mauri
"X-ray absorption near-edge structure calculations with the pseudopotentials: Application to the K edge in diamond and αalpha
-quartz"
Phys. Rev. B 66, 195107 (2002)

The implementation of the DFT+U approximation and its application to
K-edge XAS in NiO was performed in:

C. Gougoussis, M. Calandra, A. Seitsonen, Ch. Brouder, A. Shukla, F. Mauri
" Intrinsic charge transfer gap in NiO from  Ni K -edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy", Phys. Rev. B 79, 045118 (2009)

Finally you should cite properly the Quantum Espresso package.

This module uses subroutines from PW with the general infrasturcture provided by
Quantum Espresso. 

The directory XSpectra must reside immediately under the espresso directory for Makefiles to work. 

Standart compilation: Run "make xspectra" in espresso directory where XSpectra is a subdirectory
