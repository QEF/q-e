                a) If a molecule is placed in the corner of the
                supercell, there is a discontinuity problem for the
                position operator r, which is not periodic. By setting
                lshift_d0psi=.true. the discontinuity problem is
                solved by shifting the position operator r such that
                it is continuous and well defined.
                b) If a molecule is placed in the center of the supercell,
                there is no discontinuity problem for the position operator r,
                and thus you can set lshift_d0psi=.false. But if you still
                set it to .true., this will not harm, because the position
                operator will basically remain as it is, since it is always
                centered wrt the center of the molecule.
