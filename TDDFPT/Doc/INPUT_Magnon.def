    	  Input data format: { } = optional, [ ] = it depends.

	  All quantities whose dimensions are not explicitly specified are in
	  RYDBERG ATOMIC UNITS

	  BEWARE: TABS, DOS <CR><LF> CHARACTERS ARE POTENTIAL SOURCES OF TROUBLE

          Comment lines in namelists can be introduced by a "!", exactly as in 
          fortran code. Comments lines in ``cards'' can be introduced by 
          either a "!" or a "#" character in the first position of a line.

	  Structure of the input data:
