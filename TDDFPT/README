###Time Dependent Density Functional Perturbation Theory (TDDFPT)

TD-DFPT developers would be grateful if any scientific work done with TD-DFPT
contained a reference to one of the following reference papers:

This module uses subroutines from PW and PH along with the general infrasturcture provided by
Quantum Espresso. 

The directory TDDFPT must reside immediately under the espresso directory for Makefiles to work. 

Standart compilation: Run "make tddfpt" in espresso directory where TDDFPT is a subdirectory
 
Directory Structure: 
bin      : The tddfpt related binaries
src      : The source files
Doc      : The manual
Examples : Examples and tests. If you run make under this subdirectory
           a full test is initiated (requires tddfpt to be compiled first).
           You can also perform a shorter test by "make small_test". Each example has its
           own seperate Makefile. Please refer to the README under this subdirectory for
           further information. 
tools    : Various tools:
           1) The postprocessing code for calculating absorption spectrum and polarizabilities.
           2) A script to recover reduced liouvillian in a format comprehensible to postprocessing
              code from the stdout.
