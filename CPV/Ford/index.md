## Installation 

Quantum ESPRESSO is currently distributed as source packages, but selected binary packages for Linux and Windows are also available. Since v.6.0 the distribution is split into sources, tests, examples, plus a few specialized packages and plug-ins. These packages can be automatically downloaded and installed on demand after the installation of the base distribution: see the general documentation for more information.
