  !! Return an error code in "ierr" as follows:
  !! ierr = 81  file cannot be opened (not found or not accessible)
  !! ierr >  0  error reading file
  !! ierr <= 0  file successfully read, file format is:
  !!    ierr =  0  UPF xml (unstable, experimental)
  !!    ierr = -1  UPF v.1 (deprecated)
  !!    ierr = -2  UPF v.2 (default choice)
  !!    ierr = -3  psml (experimental, Norm-Conserving only)
  !!    ierr = -4  old Vanderbilt formatted USPP (deprecated)
  !!    ierr = -5  old RRKJ3 USPP format (deprecated)
  !!    ierr = -6  old PWscf NCPP format (deorecated)
  !!    ierr = -7  Goedecker-Teter-Hutter NCPP
  !! Should be executed on a single processor
