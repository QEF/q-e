               May be larger ( for ultrasoft PP ) or somewhat smaller 
               ( but not much smaller ) than the default value. Note that
               if you have norm-conserving PP only, setting it to a larger
               value than the default is a waste of time.

occupations    CHARACTER
               a string describing the occupation of the electronic states.
               In the case of conjugate gradient style of minimization
               of the electronic states, if occupations is set to 'ensemble',

               parameter for the smearing function, only used for ensemble DFT
               calculations

nelup, neldw   REAL
               number of spin-up and spin-down electrons, respectively.
               The sum must yield nelec that must also be specified
               explicitly in this case.

multiplicity   INTEGER ( default = 0 [unspecified] )
               spin multiplicity (2s+1). 1 is singlet, 2 for doublet etc.
               if unspecified or a non-zero value is specified in nelup/neldw

tot_magnetization INTEGER ( default = -1 [unspecified] )
               majority spin - minority spin (nelup - neldw).
               if unspecified or a non-zero value is specified in nelup/neldw
               then tot_magnetization variable is ignored.
               YES, there is redundancy! nelup/neldw are enough to specify
               the spin state. However these variables are not very convenient
               and will be eliminated from the input in future versions.
	       It is recommended to use either 'multiplicity' or equivalently
               'tot_magnetization' to specify the spin state.

               parameters for modified functional to be used in
               variable-cell molecular dynamics (or in stress calculation).
               "ecfixed" is the value (in Rydberg) of the constant-cutoff; 
               "qcutz" and "q2sigma" are the height and the width (in Rydberg) 
               of the energy step for reciprocal vectors whose square modulus 
               is greater than "ecfixed". In the kinetic energy, G^2 is
               replaced by G^2 + qcutz * (1 + erf ( (G^2 - ecfixed)/q2sigma) )
               See: M. Bernasconi et al, J. Phys. Chem. Solids 56, 501 (1995)
               Comment: For what would have been ecutwfc = 25.0 Ryd in fixed cell
               calculations one should use the following set of parameters for
               cell dynamics:
               (ecutwfc = 30.0, ecfixed = 25.0, qcutz = 25.0, q2sigma = 3.0)


nr1,nr2,nr3    INTEGER
               three-dimensional FFT mesh (hard grid) for charge
               density (and scf potential). If not specified
               the grid is calculated based on the cutoff for
               charge density (see also "ecutrho")

nr1s,nr2s,nr3s INTEGER
               three-dimensional mesh for wavefunction FFT and for the smooth 
               part of charge density ( smooth grid ).

                         interchangeably with 'verlet' for a couple of ionic
                         steps in order to "cool down" the electrons and
                         return them back to the Born-Oppenheimer surface.
                         Then 'verlet' can be restarted again. This procedure 
                         is useful when electronic adiabaticity in CP is lost

remove_rigid_rot
               LOGICAL ( default = .FALSE. )
               this keyword is useful when simulating the dynamics and/or the
               thermodynamics of an isolated system. If set to true the total
               torque of the internal forces is set to zero by adding new forces
               that compensate the spurious interaction with the periodic
               images. This allowes for the use of smaller supercells.
               BEWARE: since the potential energy is no longer consistent with
               the forces (it still contains the spurious interaction with the
               repeated images), the total energy is not conserved anymore.
               However the dynamical and thermodynamical properties should be
               in closer agreement with those of an isolated system.
               Also the final energy of a structural relaxation will be higher,
               but the relaxation itself should be faster.

sw_len         INTEGER ( default = 1 )
               No. of iterations over which the field will be turned on     
               to its final value. Starting value is 0.0

               Whether to do Steepest-Descent / Conjugate-Gradient          
               localization for the Wannier function calculation            
               if TRUE, then yes, else damped dynamics.                     
               Remember, this is consistent with all the calwf options      
               as well as the tolw (see below).                            
               Not a good idea to Wannier dynamics with this if you are     
               using restart='from_scratch' option, since the spreads       
               converge fast in the beginning and ortho goes bananas.

wfdt           REAL ( default = 5.0D0 )
               The minimum step size to take in the SD/CG direction

maxwfdt        REAL ( default = 0.3D0 )
               The maximum step size to take in the SD/CG direction         
               The code calculates an optimum step size, but that may be    
               either too small (takes forever to converge)  or too large   
               (code goes crazy) . This option keeps the step size between  
               wfdt and maxwfdt. In my experience 0.1 and 0.5 work quite    
               well. (but don't blame me if it doesn't work for you           

nit            INTEGER ( default = 10 )
               Number of iterations to do for Wannier convergence.

nsd            INTEGER ( default = 10 )

               and ( nit - nsd ) will be Conjugate-Gradient.

wf_q	       REAL ( default = 1500.0D0 )
               Fictitious mass of the A matrix used for obtaining 	  
	       maximally localized Wannier functions. The unitary
	       transformation matrix U is written as exp(A) where 	  
	       A is a anti-hermitian matrix. The Damped-Dynamics is performed
	       in terms of the A matrix, and then U is computed from A.	  
	       Usually a value between 1500 and 2500 works fine, but should 
	       be tested.

wf_friction    REAL ( default = 0.3D0 )
               Damping coefficient for Damped-Dynamics.			  

nsteps         INTEGER ( default = 20 )
               Number of Damped-Dynamics steps to be performed per CP       
               iteration.

tolw           REAL ( default = 1.D-8 )
               Convergence criterion for localization.

adapt          LOGICAL ( default = .TRUE. )
               Whether to adapt the damping parameter dynamically.

calwf          INTEGER ( default = 3 )
               Wannier Function Options, can be 1,2,3,4,5
                                                                         
               1. Output the Wannier function density, nwf and wffort
                  are used for this option. see below.		          
               2. Output the Overlap matrix O_i,j=<w_i|exp{iGr}|w_j>. O is    
	          written to unit 38. For details on how O is constructed,    
                  see below.						  
               3. Perform nsteps of Wannier dynamics per CP iteration, the    
	          orbitals are now Wannier Functions, not Kohn-Sham orbitals. 
	          This is a Unitary transformation of the occupied subspace   
                  and does not leave the CP Lagrangian invariant. Expectation  
	          values remain the same. So you will **NOT** have a constant 
	          of motion during the run. Don't freak out, its normal.      
               4. This option starts for the KS states and does 1 CP iteration
                  and nsteps of Damped-Dynamics to generate  maximally         
 	          localized wannier functions. Its useful when you have the   
	          converged KS groundstate and want to get to the converged   
	          Wannier function groundstate in 1 CP Iteration.
               5. This option is similar to calwf 1, except that the output is
	          the Wannier function/wavefunction, and not the orbital      
                  density. See nwf below.
									  
nwf            INTEGER ( default = 0 )
               This option is used with calwf 1 and calwf 5. with calwf=1,  
	       it tells the code how many Orbital densities are to be       
 	       output. With calwf=5, set this to 1(i.e calwf=5 only writes  
	       one state during one run. so if you want 10 states, you have 
	       to run the code 10 times). With calwf=1, you can print many  
	       orbital densities in a single run.
               See also the PLOT_WANNIER card for specifying the states to 
               be printed.

wffort	       INTEGER ( default = 40 )
               This tells the code where to dump the orbital densities. Used
               only with CALWF=1. for e.g. if you want to print 2 orbital   
               densities, set calwf=1, nwf=2 and wffort to an appropriate   
               number (e.g. 40) then the first orbital density will be      
               output to fort.40, the second to fort.41 and so on. Note that
               in the current implementation, the following units are used  
               21,22,24,25,26,27,28,38,39,77,78 and whatever you define as  
               ndr and ndw. so use number other than these.                 

writev         LOGICAL ( default = .FALSE. )
               Output the charge density (g-space) and the list of g-vectors
               This is useful if you want to reconstruct the electrostatic  
               potential using the Poisson equation. If .TRUE. then the     
	       code will output the g-space charge density and the list     
               if G-vectors, and STOP.                                      
               Charge density is written to : CH_DEN_G_PARA.ispin (1 or 2   
               depending on the number of spin types) or CH_DEN_G_SERL.ispin
               depending on if the code is being run in parallel or serial  
               G-vectors are written to G_PARA or G_SERL.                   
                                                                         
Nota Bene 1:   For calwf = 5, wffort is not used. The 			  
	       Wannier/Wave(function) coefficients are written to unit 22 
	       and the corresponding g-vectors (basis vectors) are        
 	       written to unit 21. This option gives the g-vecs and       
	       their coeffs. in reciprocal space, and the coeffs. are     
               complex. You will have to convert them to real space       
               if you want to plot them for visualization. calwf=1 gives  
	       the orbital densities in real space, and this is usually   
               good enough for visualization.
									  
Output files used by Wannier Function options are the following

      fort.21: Used only when calwf=5, contains the full list of g-vecs. 
      fort.22: Used Only when calwf=5, contains the coeffs. corresponding
               to the g-vectors in fort.21				  
      fort.24: Used with calwf=3,contains the average spread 	          
      fort.25: Used with calwf=3, contains the individual Wannier        
               Function Spread of each state 		                  
      fort.26: Used with calwf=3, contains the wannier centers along a   
               trajectory.
      fort.27: Used with calwf=3 and 4,  contains some general runtime   
               information from ddyn, the subroutine that actually       
               does the localization of the orbitals.                    
      fort.28: Used only if efield=.TRUE. , contains the polarization    
               contribution to the total energy.			  
									  
Also, The center of mass is fixed during the Molecular Dynamics.        
									  
BEWARE : THIS WILL ONLY WORK IF THE NUMBER OF PROCESSORS IS LESS THAN OR
         EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF STATES.

  The first group ( identifier="first_image" ) contains the first image,
  the last group  ( identifier="last_image" )  contains the last image.
  There is also the possibility of specifying intermediate images; in this case

  The special axis is the z-axis, one basal-plane vector is along x, 
  and the other basal-plane vector is at angle beta for monoclinic 
  (beta is not actually used), at 120 degrees for trigonal and hexagonal(p)
  groups, and at 90 degrees for remaining groups, excepted fcc, bcc, 
  tetragonal(i), for which the crystallographic vectors are as follows:

  fcc bravais lattice.
  ====================

  a1=(a/2)(-1,0,1), a2=(a/2)(0,1,1), a3=(a/2)(-1,1,0).

  bcc bravais lattice.
  ====================

  a1=(a/2)(1,1,1), a2=(a/2)(-1,1,1), a3=(a/2)(-1,-1,1).

  tetragonal (i) bravais lattices.
  ================================
  a1=(a/2,a/2,c/2), a2=(a/2,-a/2,c/2), a3=(-a/2,-a/2,c/2).

  trigonal(r) groups.
  ===================

  for these groups, the z-axis is chosen as the 3-fold axis, but the
  crystallographic vectors form a three-fold star around the z-axis,
  and the primitive cell is a simple rhombohedron. if c is the cosine
  of the angle between any pair of crystallographic vectors, and if
  tx=sqrt((1-c)/2), ty=sqrt((1-c)/6), tz=sqrt((1+2c)/3), the crystal-
  lographic vectors are:

        a1=a(0,2ty,tz),  a2=a(tx,-ty,tz),  a3=a(-tx,-ty,tz).

  bco base centered orthorhombic
  =============================
  a1=(a/2,b/2,0), a2=(-a/2,b/2,0), a3=(0,0,c)
