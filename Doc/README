This is the available documentation for the Quantum-ESPRESSO package:

users-guide.tex    User's Guide for Quantum-ESPRESSO
                   Requires "html.sty" (from latex2html package): if
                   not available, comment "\usepackage{html}" and
                   uncomment "\def\htmladdnormallink#1#2{#1}" near the
                   beginning of the file.
