XSPECTRA
---------
by C. Gougoussis, M. Calandra, A. Seitsonen and F. Mauri

The theoretical approach on which XSpectra is based was
described in: 

Christos Gougoussis, Matteo Calandra, Ari P. Seitsonen, Francesco Mauri,
"First principles calculations of X-ray absorption in an ultrasoft 
pseudopotentials scheme: from $\alpha$-quartz to high-T$_c$ compounds",
Phys. Rev. B 80, 075102 (2009)  

you should cite this work in all publications using this software.

If you use only Norm Conserving pseudopotentials, you should also
cite the following publication:

M. Taillefumier, D. Cabaret, A. M. Flank, and F. Mauri
"X-ray absorption near-edge structure calculations with the pseudopotentials: Application to the K edge in diamond and αalpha-quartz"
Phys. Rev. B 66, 195107 (2002)

The implementation of the DFT+U approximation and its application to
K-edge XAS in NiO was performed in:

C. Gougoussis, M. Calandra, A. Seitsonen, Ch. Brouder, A. Shukla, F. Mauri
" Intrinsic charge transfer gap in NiO from  Ni K -edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy", Phys. Rev. B 79, 045118 (2009)


Finally you should cite properly the Quantum Espresso package.

XSpectra is a post-processing tools that relies on the output 
(the charge density) of the PWscf code (pw.x). 
Thus a scf calculation needs to be done before running 
xspectra.x.

To simulate core-hole effects, a pseudopotential with a hole in the s
state (1s for K-edges, 2s for L1-edges,...) needs to be generated 
for the absorbing atom. Some of these 
pseudopotentials are available in the Xspectra examples directory,
some other qre available on the QE pseudopotential web-page with the
label "*star1s*_gipaw*" for K-edges, "*star2s*_gipaw*" for L1-edges and so on. 

The self-consistent calculation is then performed on a supercell including
the absorbing atom. The size of the supercell needs to be verified from
system to system, since fairly large supercells are necessary for convergence.
If core-hole effects need not to be taken into account then a calculation on
a single cell with a standard pseudopotential (i.e. without the core-hole) 
is enough. 

Since xspectra.x uses GIPAW reconstruction of the all electron wavefunction
the pseudopotential needs to contain information about GIPAW reconstruction.
There is no limit to the number of GIPAW projector that can be included. Note
however that two projectors are typically enough to obtain XAS spectra
converged up to 30-40 eV from the Fermi level.
The use of a single projector is discouraged, particularly when semicore
states are present. If more then two projectors are used, linear independence
of the projectors should be explicitly verified (verbosity='high'). 

Once the scf charge density has been obtained, the xspectra.x code can be 
used as a post-processing tool. Note that the X-ray absorption spectra
can be calculated on a larger mesh, different from that used in the 
PWscf scf run. Convergence need to be tested also for this second mesh.
Xspectra calculates then the XAS dipolar or quadrupolar contributions
using the lanczos method and the continued fraction.
This approach does not require the explicit calculation of empty states
and it is consequently very fast (only the charge density is needed).
The code needs the 1s radial core wavefunction 
(for the 1s state in the absence of a 
core-hole) in input. This wavefunction is included in the pseudo
and can be extracted using the script upf2plotcore.sh
in the directory ~/Pw/qe-forge/espresso/XSpectra/
of the QE distribution. Note that this script works only for UPF
version 1.
This is necessary to calculate the XAS matrix element.

The output spectrum can be separated in its spin-up and 
spin-down polarizations.
DFT+U calculations  and collinear magnetism are possible.
Ultrasoft pseudopotentials are allowed.
Soon K-edge XMCD will be included in the package.

 In order to cut the occupied states, the program performs an integration
 over the variable t in ] 0, infinity [. 
 For more details see ref. 
  Ch. Brouder, M. Alouani, K. H. Bennemann, Phys. Rev. B 54 (1996) p.7334-49.
 The integration is done with t going in two opposite directions, 
 from the start value cut_startt. So, the integration
 is done over ]cut_tinf,cut_startt] at least with step cut_stepl, and
 over [cut_startt,cut_tsup[ at least with step cut_stepu. 
 There are two arrays of size
 cut_nmeml and cut_nmemu 
 in order to save green functions values. There is an area near
 the fermi level f size cut_desmooth (in eV) where the cross section 
 is interpolated in order to avoid a divergence.
