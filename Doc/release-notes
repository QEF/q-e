Incompatible Changes in CVS version:

* nelec, nelup, neldw variables removed from input
  Use tot_charge, tot_magnetization or multiplicity instead
* ortho_para variable removed from input
  Use command-line option "-ndiag N" or "-northo N" instead

Fixed in cvs version:

  * Parallel execution of D3 wasn't working in at least some cases
    (e.g. with k-point parallelization) since a long time

Fixed in version 4.1.1:

  * newly added DFT-D wasn't working properly with k-point parallelization

  * Gamma-only phonon code wasn't working any longer if pseudopotentials
    with nonlinear core correction were used

  * Check of lspinorb flag consistency between left/right lead and
    scattering region in pwcond.x was not working properly; wrong
    print-out of E-Ef when Nchannels=0 also fixed.

  * Check on convergence of variable-cell damped dynamics was not
    working as expected in the presence of constraints

  * Velocity rescaling in CP was not working, and it was performed
    also if not required when ion velocities were set to 'random'

  * ESPRESSO_TMPDIR is caught by gipaw.x as well
 
  * Phonon calculation could not be performed with only local PPs

  * Small error in the definition of the saw-tooth potential for slab
    calculations with E-field: the "physical" dimensions of the R-space
    grid are nr1,nr2,nr3 NOT nrx1,nrx2,nrx3

  * Misc compilation problem for: gfortran v.4.1 (casino2upf),
    pathscale 3.2 (mp_base),  xlf 12.1 (buggy compilation of iotk)

  * Possible memory leak in PW/update_pot.f90

  * Spin-polarized calculations in CPV had a bug since v.4.1  when using
    parallel distributed diagonalization ("ortho" group)

  * FFT glitches: Nec SX routines were not properly called,
    OpenMP was not compatible with all FFTs

  * augmentation charges in real space (tqr=.true.) and k-point
    parallelization (pools) was not working due to bogus check

  * fhi2upf.x : fixed segmentation fault in some cases with ifort

  * OLYP XC functional was incorrectly flagged as Meta-GGA 
    (courtesy of Latevi Max Lawson Daku)

  * Minor corrections and extensions to the documentation

New in version 4.1:

  * New exchange-correlation functionals: 
    PBEsol and WC (courtesy of Willam Parker, Ohio State U.)
    LDA with finite-size corrections (Kwee, Zhang, Krakauer,
    courtesy of Ester Sola and Dario Alfe)

  * Dispersion calculation with DFT-D (Grimme)

  * mixed openMP-MPI parallelization (very experimental)
 
Fixed in version 4.1:

  * the sum of all nuclear forces is no longer forced to zero in 
    Car-Parrinello dynamics. Forcing them to zero was not completely
    correct -- only the sum of nuclear plus "electronic" forces should 
    be exactly zero -- and was causing loss of ergodicity in some cases. 

  * symmetry analysis for spin-orbit case: a few signs in the character 
    tables of C_3 and S_6 have been changed so that they agree with the
    Koster-Dimmock-Wheeler-Statz tables.

  * a problem in the plotting routine plotband.f90 could yield wrong
    band plots even when the symmetry classification was correct.  

  * serious bug in plotting code pp.x: all plots requiring Fourier space
    interpolation, i.e.: 1d, 2d, user-supplied 3d grid, spherical average,
    were yielding incorrect results if performed on data produced by pw.x
    (and cp.x) using Gamma-only option. Workaround introduced, but it works
    (around) only if the desired data is first saved to file, then plotted.

  * stop_run was not properly deleting files in the case of path calculations 

  * Coulomb pseudopotentials in UPF v.2 format were not working 
    (courtesy of Andrea Ferretti)

  * electron-phonon calculation on a uniform grid of q-points + 
    Delta Vscf and dynamical matrices read from file should be fine now:
    the Delta Vscf saved to file are no longer overwritten at each q-point.
    Also: the xml file written by pw.x is no longer overwritten by ph.x.

  * nasty problem with C routines receiving fortran strings as arguments.
    The way it was done may lead to stack corruption and all kinds of
    unexpected and mysterious problems under some circumstances.
    Now fortran strings are converted to integer arrays, that can be
    safely passed to C, and converted back in Modules/wrappers.f90

  * USPP generated with ld1.x may have been incorrectly written to
    UPF format v.2 in all 4.0.x versions . The error may have been
    small enough to go unnoticed but may be not negligible. All USPP
    in UPF format tagged as version 2.0.0 should be regenerated.

Fixed in version 4.0.5:

  * option calwf=1 (CPV with Wannier functions) was not working

  * more problems in symmetry analysis in special cases for C_4h and
    D_2h symmetry

  * various small memory leaks or double allocations in special cases

  * problem with effective charges d Force / d E in the noncollinear+NLCC case

  * calculation of ionic dipole, used for calculations with sawtooth 
    potential, used wrong reference point assuming the field parallel
    to z axis (while it can be parallel to any reciprocal basis vector). 
    All relax calculation in non-orthorombic cells, and all calculations
    with option tefield and edir/=3, were completely wrong. Non-relax 
    calculation in the same cathegory were correct, apart from a constant, 
    but system-dependent, addictive factor in total energy.

  * generation of supercells in matdyn was not working (since a long time)

  * PWCOND: two more small bug fixed (in CVS since june)

Fixed in version 4.0.4:

  * Structural optimization with external sawtooth potential was not
    working correctly (electric field disappeared after first run).
    All versions after october 2005 affected.

  *  problem in FFTW v.3 driver in parallel execution (Davide)

  *  option maxirr disabled

  *  memory leak in pw_readfile in parallel

  *  the phonon code was not working when wf_collect=.true. and
     either ldisp=.true. or lnscf=.true. 

  *  incorrect make.sys produced by configure on some IBM machines

  *  rigid.f90: the fix introduced in v. 4.0.1 to improve convergence
     wasn't really correct 

Fixed in version 4.0.3:

  * CPV: array qv allocated in newd wasn't deallocated in all cases,
    leading to either a crash or a memory leak (Ralph)

  * Task groups bug fix: array tg_rho was not cleared at every k point cycle. 
    This was causing problems with some combinations of "-npool" and "-ntg".

  * PWCOND: a bug with some array bounds fixed (A. Smogunov) 

  * Problem with the generation of the atomic wavefunctions in the
    projwfc code when a scalar relativistic PP is used with lspinorb=.true.

  * Bug fix in symmetry analysis for the case S_6 (reported by Marino 
    Vetuschi Zuccolini) and also in: S_4, T_h, C_3h, C_4h, C_6h. 

Fixed in version 4.0.2:

  * Nuclear masses not correctly displayed for variable-cell calculations

  * Probably all results for EFG (electric field gradients) were wrong,
    due to an incorrect multiplication of "r" with "alat" inside a loop
    (should have been outside: routine PW/ewald_dipole.f90)

  * Calculation with fixed magnetization and nspin=2 (using 2 fermi
    levels) was not working in v. 4.0.1

  * non linear core correction was not detected in FPMD run

  * effective charges + US PP + spin-orbit not correct in noncubic cases.

  * symm_type was not properly set by pw_restart (used in various 
    post-processing including phonons) when using free lattice 
    (ibrav=0) and symm_type=hexagonal.

  *  CP: conjugate gradient had a bug in some cases of parallel 
     execution. Also: default max number of iterations was not
     what was promised in the documentation (100)

  *  phonon: alpha_pv depended on the number of  unoccupied bands
     in insulators (harmless).

  *  fpmd was using wrong forces propagate cell variables in
     variable-cell calculations. Also: interpolation tables
     were a little bit too small for variable cell simulation
     (not really a bug but it could be annoying)

  *  Minor glitch in configure for pathscale compiler. Note that 
     in the machine that has been tested, compilation of iotk 
     fails for mysterious reasons if CPP = pathcc -E, while it
     works with CPP = /lib/cpp -P --traditional

Fixed in version 4.0.1:

  *  Some scripts used in tests/ and in examples were not
     posix-compliant and could fail in some cases

  *  In cg calculations with cp, the case of no spin multiplicity
     (i.e. nspin=1) with odd number of bands was yielding an error
      "c second dimension too small"

  *  rigid.f90: sum over G-space in long-range term, used in q2r.x 
     and matdyn.x, wasn't really converged for sufficiently large cells

  *  too many automatic arrays in "set_asr" called in matdyn.f90,
     causing a mysterious crash for systems larger than a few atoms

  *  incorrect call to "sgama" in matdyn.f90 could lead to failures
     with strange messages when calculating phonon DOS

  *  c_mkdir is explicitly defined as integer*4 in order to prevent
     problems in 64-bit machines with default 64-bit integers

  *  PP/chdens.f90: incorrect orthogonality test for axis

  *  GIPAW: 10^3 factor missing in conversion

  *  GIPAW: paw_recon[]%paw_betar[] was not initialised and caused NaN's
     with IBM compilers. Courtesy of Christos Gougoussis (IMPMC, Paris).

  *  Minor glitches in PWgui

  *  cppp.x was not working in v.4.0
  
  *  Workaround for bluegene weirdness extended to complex hamiltonians

  *  PP/projwfc.f90: Problems with file names in systems > 1000 atoms

  *  Workaround for ATLAS bug causing random crashes

  *  Minor bug in helpdoc: adding syntaxFlush to linecard

  *  Incorrect dimensions in PW/local.f90 (courtesy of Zhiping)

Fixed in version 4.0:

  *  Unpredictable results when the output from a spin-polarized CP
     calculation was used for post-processing. This was due to an
     incorrect treatment of the case where the number of up and down
     states are not the same. There was also an inconsistency in the 
     treatment of the number of up and down electrons, that can be in
     principle real, unlike the number of states that is integer

  *  In MD calculations with PWscf, there was the possibility of an
     out-of-bound error, with unpredictable consequences, including 
     in at least one case hanging of parallel jobs

  *  Due to a bad dimensioning of variable hubbard_l, DFT+U results could 
     be wrong if atomic type N with U term has N > L=maximum hubbard L

  *  a few symmetries were confusing the symmetry finder

  *  serious bugs in Berry's phase calculation. It affected only the US 
     case and only some terms, so the error was small but not negligible. 
     There were three different bugs, one introduced when the spherical
     harmonics were modified in the rest of the code, two that I think
     have been there from the beginning.

  *  various glitches with wf_collect option in the noncollinear case

  *  mix_rho was not working properly for lsda with data saved to file
     and double grid

Fixed in version 3.2.1-3.2.3:

  *  CP in parallel execution had a serious bug if the third dimension
     of FFT arrays (nr3x/nr3sx) was not the same as FFT order (nr3/nr3s)

  *  restart of pw.x in parallel could go bananas under some not-so-unusual
     circumstances, due to bad setting of a variable

  *  various phonon glitches: pools and lsda, pools and dispersions,
     option lnscf, were not working

  *  incorrect exchange-correlation contribution to the electro-optical 
     coefficient

  *  check for stop condition was unsafe with pools and could hang pw.x

  *  fixed occupations in parallel: array not allocated on all processors

  *  Yet another problem of poor accuracy of routines calculating spherical 
     bessel functions - harmless except in some cases of pseudopotential 
     generation 

  *  DOS EOF characters present in some files could cause trouble
     during installation

  *  restart in phonon calculations was not always properly working

  *  possible divide-by-zero error in dV_xc/dz (spin polarized case)

  *  gamma_gamma symmetry was not working for open-shell molecules

  *  T_h group not correctly identified in postprocessing

  *  missing initialization of rho could lead to serious trouble
     if the physical and true dimensions of FFT grid did not coincide

  *  Ewald real-space term could have been incorrectly calculated 
     if an atom was far away from the unit cell

  *  Some variables were used before they were initialized - this could
     lead to crashes or unpredictable behaviour on some machines

  *  lattice parameters a,b,c,cosab,cosac,cosbc were not properly 
     copied to the celldm in the case of triclinic lattice

Fixed in version 3.2:

  *  In same cases the energy under an external sawtooth potential
     simulating an electric field was not correct

  *  Case ibrav=13 fixed for good this time!!!

  *  Bug in PH/clinear.f90 for cells having nr1 /= nr2 may have
     affected new electron-phonon algorithm
  
  *  Poor accuracy of routines calculating spherical bessel functions
     for high l and small q - harmless except in very special cases
  
  *  LDA+U with variable-cell dynamics/relaxation was wrong due to
     missing rescaling of the integrals of atomic wavefunctions.
     This bug has been present since at least 3.0 

  *  Parallel subspace diagonalization could occasionally fail;
     replaced by a new algorithm that is much more stable 

  *  Restart problems in parallel run for two cases:
     1) with pools, 2) with local filesystems

Fixed in version 3.1.1:

  *  Methfessel-Paxton broadening was hardcoded in the calculation of
     the electron-phonon coefficients (ngauss1=1 in PH/elphon.f90).
     There is no good reason to use this instead of simple gaussian
     (ngauss1=0), which, moreover, guarantees positive definite results.

Fixed in version 3.1:

  *  various problems in stress calculation, both in PW and in CP

  *  in phonon dispersion calculation, the threshold for diagonalization
     was not always what was expected to be. Minor numerical differences 
     could result.

  *  the new algorithm for electron-phonon calculation removes a serious
     bug in the old algorithm, present in v.2.1 to 3 included: when 
     electron-phonon coefficients were calculated together with the 
     dynamical matrix, the symmetrization of coeffcients was incorrect.
     Results from separate calculations were correct.

Fixed in version 3.0:

  *  latgen.f90 : case ibrav=13 bad

  *  kpoints.f : case ibrav=5 bad

Fixed in version 2.1.5:

  *   bad forces and stresses with LDA+U in spin-unpolarised case

  *   bad printout of Lowdin charges in projwfc

  *   FPMD had a problem with some types of UPF PPs
 
Fixed in version 2.1.4:

  *   Incorrect initial guess for occupancies in LDA+U (init_ns)

  *   bogus error in postprocessing with local pseudopotentials only

  *   several errors in third-order energy derivatives (D3/)

  *   checks on several unimplemented cases were missing

Fixed in version 2.1.3:
 
  *  case ibrav=0 in CPV was not properly working

  *  forces in CP with core corrections were wrong
     (reported by Giacomo Saielli)

  *  damped variable-cell dynamics in PWscf was not working properly

  *  lambda.x could yield NaN's on negative frequencies

  *  option "write_save" was not working in parallel

  *  diagonalization of (0,0) matrix in init_paw_1

  *  out-of-bound error in readnewvan.f90 fixed

  *  FPMD: bug with UPF PP when betas are not ordered as l=0,1,2,...

  *  Possible out-of-bound error with US PP in some cases

  *  Martins-Troullier norm-conserving PP generation had a small
     error when rcloc > rcut(l)

  *  the default for relativistic vs nonrelativistic calculation
     in the atomic code was the opposite of what was intended

  *  electron-phonon calculation was not working properly if called
     after a restart

  *  Parallel execution on local filesystems (i.e. not visible to all
     processors) could hang due to a bad check in charge extrapolation

  *  When imposing hermiticity in matdyn.x and dynmat.x codes in pwtools
     routine dyndiag was actually computing the complex conjugate of
     the dynamical matrix. Eigenvectors were therefore wrong, while
     eigenvalues were fine. (thanks to Nicolas Mounet)

Fixed in version 2.1.2:

  *  The phonon code was yielding incorrect results when 4-dimensional 
     irreps were present (i.e. A point in graphite) and ultrasoft PP used
      (reported by Nicolas Mounet)

  *  in some cases ld1 was writing a bad UPF file

  *  in some cases the charge density was not conserved during
     the charge mixing

  *  various problems with potential extrapolation in neb and smd

  *  variable-cell dynamics and optimization was not working in parallel

  *  Berry phase calculation in parallel should have been disabled

  *  bug in readfile_config when restarting without a "*.save" file

  *  crash in pw2casino due to bad call to v_of_rho

Fixed in version 2.1.1:

  *  memory leak in Raman code

  *  disproportionate memory requirement in phonon code with USPP

  *  dangerous calls to read_restart_tetra and write_restart_tetra
     when restarting with no allocated tetrahedra
 
  *  vc-relax was not working

  *  projwfc failed with lda+U 

  *  incorrect automatic generation of k-points in the non colinear case:
     inversion symmetry is not always present because of the presence of  
     a magnetic field in the Hamiltonian

  *  electron-phonon calculation was not working if called directly
     after a phonon calculation

  *  PWCOND + FFTW + parallel execution = not good

  *  cell minimization with steepest descent was not working (CP/FPMD)

  *  various Alpha, IBM, SGI, SUN, PGI compilation problems

Fixed in version 2.1:

  *  various T3E compilation problems

  *  cpmd2upf was yielding incorrect DFT if converting BLYP PPs

  *  some variables not properly written and read in restart file

  *  The value of gamma_only was not correctly set when restarting or
     reading from file with option __NEW_PUNCH enabled

  *  Incorrect calculation of eloc in pw2casino

  *  Two serious bugs in the local-TF screening :
     possible occurrence of division by zero (present since v1.2),
     wrong mixing of spin polarized systems

  *  cpmd2upf failed with some files due to bad check

  *  Intel compiler v.8: wavefunction files four times bigger than needed

  *  compilation problems on some version of SGI compiler

  *  non-collinear code was not working with insulators and nbnd > nelec/2

  *  multiple writes to file in parallel execution when calculating
     electron-phonon coefficients

  *  various bugs in LBFGS

  *  NEB + LDA+U = crash

  *  compilation problems with __NEW_PUNCH

  *  planar average crashed if used with a cubic system

  *  Gamma-only phonon code not working for Raman calculations
     in some cases

  *  yet another bug in phonon and k-point parallelization when
     reading namelist (phq_readin)

  *  options startingwfc and startingpot were ignored if restarting
     from a previous calculation

  *  pw2casino interface didn't work properly in spin-polarized case
     and didn't use variable "outdir"

  *  minor bug in pwtools/pwo2xsf.sh 

  *  serious bug in the path interpolator

  *  phonon, post_processing, various other auxiliary codes were
     not working with k-point parallelization (pools) due to 
     double call to init_pool

Fixed in version 2.0 :
  
  *  wrong results when running Berry-phase calculation in parallel execution:
     it was not implemented but no warning was issued

  *  variable-cell code was subject to overflow and floating-point errors

  *  phonon + nosym=.true. was not properly done

  *  out-of-bound error in Berry Phase calculation

  *  out-of-bound errors in phonon if 4-dimensional irreps were present
     (also d3.x was not working properly in this case)

  *  Berry-phase calculation had problems in low-symmetry cases

  *  phonon with k-point parallelization (pools) was yielding wrong
     results in some cases (since v. 1.2 included)

  *  upftools/cpmd2upf.f90: wrong conversion due to Rydberg-Hartree mess

  *  PW/input.f90: lattice parameter a converted to wrong units if input
     is given as a,b,c,cos(ab),cos(ac),cos(bc) instead of celldm(:)

  *  Wrong coordinates written if atomic_positions='crystal'
     (thanks to Francois Willaime)

Fixed in version 1.3.0 :

  *  PH/elphon.f90 : el-ph calculation in the US case was not correctly
     working in v.1.2.0 (it was not implemented in previous versions).
     An US term in the calculation of deltaV * psi_v was missing.
     Fixed by M. Wierzbowska and SdG

  *  various problems caused by too short file names fixed:
     file and directory names up to 80 characters are allowed
     (thanks to Serguei Patchkovskii and others) 

  *  LAPACK routines DSYTRF and DYSTRI require some character arguments
     (like 'U', 'L'). While most LAPACK implementations accept both
     lowercase and uppercase arguments, the standard is uppercase only.
     Various anomalies in self-consistency were caused by lowercase
     arguments.

  *  Incorrect Make.pc_abs fixed

  *  PGI compiler v.3.3-2 on Linux: PP/chdens.x coredump fixed
 
  *  various T3E glitches in v.1.2.0 fixed

  *  PP/work_functions.f90 : STM maps did not work in version 1.2.0
     (undefined variable lscf was used, call to sum_band no longer needed)

  *  PP/projwave.f90: symmetrization of projected dos was incorrectly 
     performed using d1,d2,or d3 instead of their transponse.
     (affects all previous versions)

  *  PW/new_ns.f90: symmetrization of occupation matrix ns needed for LDA+U
     calculations used incorrectly d2 matrices instead of their transponse. 
     Thanks to Lixin He for finding out the problem and the solution.
     (affects all previous versions)
  
Fixed in version 1.2.0 (f90) :

  *  dynmat.f90: out-of-bound error fixed

  *  pplib/chdens.F90, pplib/projwave.F90 : compilation problems
     for alpha (found by Giovanni Cantele)

  *  postprocessing routines: problems with unallocate pointers
     passed to subroutine plot_io fixed (found by various people)

  *  postprocessing with ibrav=0 was not working properly

  *  rather serious bug in cinitcgg (used by conjugate-gradient
     diagonalization) could produce mysterious crashes. The bug 
     appeared in version 1.1.1.

  *  pplib/dos.f90 was not plotting the expected energy window

  *  pplib/chdens.F90, pplib/average.F90 : wrong call to setv
     could cause an out-of-bound error

Fixed in version 1.1.2 (f90) :

  *  a check on the number of arguments to command line in parallel
     execution was added - Intel compiler crashes if attempting to
     read a nonexistent argument

  *  tmp_dir was incorrectly truncated to 35 characters in
     parallel execution

  *  variable "kfac" was not deallocated in stres_knl. A crash in 
     variable-cell MD could result.

  *  an inconsistent check between the calling program (gen_us_dj)
     and the routine calculating j_l(r) (sph_bes) could result in 
     error stop when calculating stress or dielectric properties

  *  errors at file close in pw.x and phonon.x in some cases

  *  tetrahedra work for parallel execution 
     (ltetra is now distributed in bcast_input)

  *  fixed some problems in automatic dependencies (Giovanni Cantele)

Fixed in version 1.1.1 (f90) and 1.0.3 (f77) :

  *  LSDA calculations need either gaussian broadening or tetrahedra
     but no input check was performed 

  *  restarting from a run interrupted at the end of self-consistency
     yielded wrong forces

  *  projwave.F (projection over atomic functions) was not working
     with atoms having semicore states (found by Seungwu Han)

  *  stm.F : option stm_wfc_matching was not working properly 
     if symmetry was present (no symmetrization was performed)

  *  dynmat.x : displacement patterns in "molden" format were
     incorrectly divided by the square root of atomic masses

  *  d3: misc. problems in parallel execution fixed

Fixed in version 1.1.0 (f90) and 1.0.2 (f77) : 

  *  an inconsistency in the indexing of pseudopotential arrays could
     yield bad dielectric tensors and effective charges if atoms where
     not listed as first all atoms of type 1, then all atoms of type 2,
     and so on (found by Nathalie Vast)

  *  phonon with ibrav=0 was not working (info on symm_type was lost:
     found by Michele Lazzeri)

  *  the generation of the two random matrices needed in the calculation
     of third order derivatives was incorrect because the random seed
     was not reset. This produced crazy results for q<>0 calculations.

  *  the check on existence of tmp_dir did not work properly on 
     Compaq (formerly Dec) alphas (thanks to Guido Roma and Alberto
     Debernardi).

  *  a system containing local pseudopotentials only (i.e. H)
     produced a segmentation fault error

  *  getenv was incorrectly called on PC's using Absoft compiler:
     the default pseudopotential directory was incorrect

  *  out-of-bound bug in pplib/dosg.f fixed. It could have caused
     mysterious crashes or weird results in DOS calculations using
     gaussian broadening.  Thanks to Gun-Do Lee for fixing the bug.

  *  a missing initialization to zero in gen_us_dy.F could have
     yielded a wrong stress in some cases

  *  phonons in an insulator did not work if more bands (nbnd) 
     were specified than filled valence band only

  *  electron-phonon calculation was incorrect if nonlocal PPs
     were used (that is, almost always)

  *  Real space term in third order derivative of ewald energy
     was missing (not exactly a bug, but introduced a small error
     that could be not negligible in some cases)

  *  bad call in dynmat.f corrected 

  *  compilation problems for PC clusters fixed (thanks to Nicola Marzari)

Fixed in version 1.0.1:

  *  recovering from a previous run in pw.x did not work on PC's

  *  recovering from a previous run in pw.x did not work for stress
     calculation

  *  poolrecover did not compile on some machines (thanks to Eric Wu)
 
  *  PC with absoft compiler (and maybe other cases as well):
     bad type conversions for REAL and CMPLX resulted in poor
     convergence in some test cases. DCMPLX, DREAL used instead.

  *  Asymptotic high- and low-density formulae used in PW91 and PBE
     unpolarized functionals gave a small but not negligible error,
     leading to bad convergence of structural optimization
