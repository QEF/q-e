                        for a metal, 20% more (minimum 4 more)
               Note that in spin-polarized calculations the number of
               k-point, not the number of bands per k-point, is doubled

  One for the first image ( identifier="first_image" must be followed by "nat" 
  position cards ) and one for the last image ( identifier="last_image" must 
  be followed by "nat" position cards )
  There is also the possibility of specifying intermediate images; in this case
  their coordinates must be set between the first_image and the last_image.
  ( identifier="intermediate_image" must be followed by "nat" position cards ). 
  Image configurations must be specified in the following order:

  IMPORTANT: the total number of configurations specified in the input file 
             must be less than num_of_images (as specified in &IONS).
             The initial path is obtained interpolatig between the specified
             configurations so that all images are equispaced (only the

  The special axis is the z-axis, one basal-plane vector is along x, 
  and the other basal-plane vector is at angle beta for monoclinic 
  (beta is not actually used), at 120 degrees for trigonal and hexagonal(p)
  groups, and at 90 degrees for remaining groups, excepted fcc, bcc, 
  tetragonal(i), for which the crystallographic vectors are as follows:

  fcc bravais lattice.
  ====================

  a1=(a/2)(-1,0,1), a2=(a/2)(0,1,1), a3=(a/2)(-1,1,0).

  bcc bravais lattice.
  ====================

  a1=(a/2)(1,1,1), a2=(a/2)(-1,1,1), a3=(a/2)(-1,-1,1).

  tetragonal (i) bravais lattices.
  ================================
  a1=(a/2,a/2,c/2), a2=(a/2,-a/2,c/2), a3=(-a/2,-a/2,c/2).

  trigonal(r) groups.
  ===================

  for these groups, the z-axis is chosen as the 3-fold axis, but the
  crystallographic vectors form a three-fold star around the z-axis,
  and the primitive cell is a simple rhombohedron. if c is the cosine
  of the angle between any pair of crystallographic vectors, and if
  tx=sqrt((1-c)/2), ty=sqrt((1-c)/6), tz=sqrt((1+2c)/3), the crystal-
  lographic vectors are:

        a1=a(0,2ty,tz),  a2=a(tx,-ty,tz),  a3=a(-tx,-ty,tz).

  bco base centered orthorhombic
  =============================
  a1=(a/2,b/2,0), a2=(-a/2,b/2,0), a3=(0,0,c)
