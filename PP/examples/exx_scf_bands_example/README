This example shows how to use pw.x to calculate the total energy
and the band structure of Silicon using hybrid HSE functional.

Additional k-points along high-symmetry directions are included
in the self-consistent calculation with zero weight, using the
ADDITIONAL_K_POINTS card.

The path is extracted from the results of bands.x using plotbands.x
