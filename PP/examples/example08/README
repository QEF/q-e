This example shows how to plot the squared modulus of the Hubbard 
projectors functions of DFT+U. 

It is necessary to set disk_io = 'medium' in the pw.x input file 
in order to save on disk the Hubbard projectors for the post-processing.

Currently, only iflag = 3 is supported, while output_format can be 5 or 6.

Current limitations:
- symmetry must be disabled
- noncollinear case is not supported
