    intro {
        @b {Purpose of ppacf.x:} 
        ACF analysis and print files to track signatures of binding
        (PRB 97, 085115 (2018)).

        For an illustration of how to use this code to set hybrid mixing 
        value, please refer to JCP 148, 194115 (2018) doi: 10.1063/1.5012870.

        The code reads the output produced by @b pw.x, extracts and calculates
        $E_{c}^{nl}$, $T_{c}^{nl}$, $E_{c,\lambda}^{LDA}$, $E_{c,\lambda}^{nl}$,
        $E_{xc,\lambda}$, $T_c^{LDA}$. 
        If @ref lfock is set to .True., the code also computes the total Fock 
        exchange value.

        With flag @ref code_num = 2, the codes can read output produced by @b VASP.

        With flag @ref lplot, the codes also out puts files containing spatial 
        variation in most of these quantities.


        The input data of this program is read from standard input or from file
        and has the following format:

        @b {Structure of the input data:}
        @b ============================

        @b &PPACF
        @b     ...
        @b /
        
        Intermediate results can be saved to disk (see variable @ref lplot in @b &PPACF)
        and later read by pp.x.
        Since the file with intermediate results is formatted, it can be safely 
        transferred to a different machine. This also allows plotting of a 
        linear combination (for instance, energy density differences) by saving 
        two intermediate files and combining them (see variables in @b &PLOT
        from pp.x .)

        All output quantities are in ATOMIC (RYDBERG) UNITS unless otherwise 
        explicitly specified.

                        for coupling-constant scaling analysis of vdW-DF versions.
                      - Wavefunction based analysis (Fock exchange energy and
