        @b {Purpose of wannier2pw.x:}
           Interface with wannier90 code to construct maximally localized Wannier functions
           that can be used in pw.x calculations for DFT+U.

           The code reads the _u.mat (_u_dis.mat) file which is generated by the wannier90.x program.
           Then, it builds the Bloch sums of Wannier functions and writes them on disk as .hub files
           in the temporary directory. Then these files are read by the pw.x program to perform the 
           DFT+U calculations using these Wannier functions as Hubbard projectors.

                when building the Wannier functions using Umn matrices from Wannier90

                as a basis to build the Hubbard projectors for DFT+U calculations. Note that
                the total number of selected Wannier functions must match the expected
                number of basis functions (e.g. 5 for d states, 3 for p states, etc per atom).
                In order to selected the Wannier functions, one has to inspect the output of 
                Wannier90 calculations and see in which oredr the Wannier functions were generated.
