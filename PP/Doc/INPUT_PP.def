    intro {
      @b {Purpose of pp.x:} data analysis and plotting.
    
      The code performs two steps:
      (1) reads the output file produced by pw.x, extract and calculate
          the desired quantity (rho, V, ...)
      (2) writes the desired quantity to file in a suitable format for
          various types of plotting and various plotting programs

      The input data of this program is read from standard input
      or from file and has the following format:

      NAMELIST @b &INPUTPP
         containing the variables for step (1), followed by

      NAMELIST @b &PLOT
         containing the variables for step (2)

      The two steps can be performed independently. In order to perform
      only step (2), leave namelist &INPUTPP blank. In order to perform
      only step (1), do not specify namelist &PLOT

      Intermediate results from step 1 can be saved to disk (see
      variable @ref filplot in &INPUTPP) and later read in step 2.
      Since the file with intermediate results is formatted, it
      can be safely transferred to a different machine. This 
      also allows plotting of a linear combination (for instance,
      charge differences) by saving two intermediate files and
      combining them (see variables @ref weight and @ref filepp in &PLOT)

      All output quantities are in ATOMIC (RYDBERG) UNITS unless
      otherwise explicitly specified.
