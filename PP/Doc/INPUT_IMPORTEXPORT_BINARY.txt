INPUT FILE DESCRIPTION

Program: importexport_binary.x / PWscf / Quantum Espresso (version: svn)
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Purpose of importexport_binary.x:
    convert the binary file for the charge density (and
    for the spin polarization) from the native binary
    format, that is not machine-independent, to a text-only
    XML format ("export" phase), and import it back to
    binary for restarting.


Structure of the input data:
============================

   &INPUTPP
     prefix = '...'
     ...
   /



========================================================================
NAMELIST: &INPUTPP

   +--------------------------------------------------------------------
   Variable:       prefix
   
   Type:           CHARACTER
   Default:        'pwscf'
   Description:    prefix of input file produced by pw.x
                   (wavefunctions are not needed)
   +--------------------------------------------------------------------
   
   +--------------------------------------------------------------------
   Variable:       outdir
   
   Type:           CHARACTER
   Description:    directory containing the input data, i.e. the same as in pw.x
   Default:        value of the ESPRESSO_TMPDIR environment variable if set;
                   current directory ('./') otherwise
   +--------------------------------------------------------------------
   
   +--------------------------------------------------------------------
   Variable:       direction
   
   Type:           CHARACTER
   Description:   
                   Selects the direction:
    
                   'export' :
                        for converting the charge density from the
                        native binary format to text XML format
    
                   'import' :
                        for converting a previously exported folder
                        from text XML format to binary format
   Default:        'export'
   +--------------------------------------------------------------------
   
   +--------------------------------------------------------------------
   Variable:       newoutdir
   
   Type:           CHARACTER
   Description:    directory into which the export data is going to be
                   generated; after the 'import' phase, it can be then used as
                   the outdir to restart for instance a pw.x NSCF calculation
   Default:        './import' if the direction is 'import',
                    './export' if the direction is 'export'
   +--------------------------------------------------------------------

:::: Notes

   
   ::: Important !
   
      The utility will also expect to find, and copy, the
      outdir/data-file.xml and the *.UPF pseudopotential files in the
      "prefix".save subdirectory, and will copy them from the outdir
      to the newoutdir. It will then convert the charge density and
      spin polarization files in the correct format. Other files,
      in particular wavefunctions and the band structure (files
      eigenvals.xml in the K????? subfolder) are ignored and not
      copied.
      
      If you need also these files, please copy them by hand (they
      are anyway already in text XML format).
      
      Note that while a NSCF calculation does not need the
      band structure files, many other codes (in particular the
      post-processing ones) may need them.
