	@b {Purpose of importexport_binary.x:}
	    convert the binary file for the charge density (and
            for the spin polarization) from the native binary
            format, that is not machine-independent, to a text-only
            XML format ("export" phase), and import it back to 
            binary for restarting.

	var prefix -type CHARACTER {
	    default { 'pwscf' } 
	    info {
		prefix of input file produced by pw.x    
		(wavefunctions are not needed)
	    }
	}

        var outdir -type CHARACTER {
            info {
                   directory containing the input data, i.e. the same as in pw.x }
            default {
                      value of the @tt ESPRESSO_TMPDIR environment variable if set;
                      current directory ('./') otherwise }
        }

        var direction -type CHARACTER {
	    options {
		info {
		    Selects the direction:
		}
		opt -val 'export' {
		    for converting the charge density from the 
		    native binary format to text XML format
		}
		opt -val 'import' {
		    for converting a previously exported folder
		    from text XML format to binary format
		}
	    }
            default { 'export' }
        }

        var newoutdir -type CHARACTER {
            info {
		directory into which the export data is going to be
		generated; after the 'import' phase, it can be then used as
		the outdir to restart for instance a pw.x NSCF calculation }
            default {
		@tt './import' if the direction is @tt 'import', 
		@br @tt './export' if the direction is @tt 'export'

	       The utility will also expect to find, and copy, the 
	       outdir/data-file.xml and the *.UPF pseudopotential files in the
	       @ref prefix.save subdirectory, and will copy them from the outdir
	       to the newoutdir. It will then convert the charge density and
	       spin polarization files in the correct format. Other files,
	       in particular wavefunctions and the band structure (files
	       eigenvals.xml in the K????? subfolder) are ignored and not
	       copied. 

	       If you need also these files, please copy them by hand (they
	       are anyway already in text XML format).
	       
	       Note that while a NSCF calculation does not need the
	       band structure files, many other codes (in particular the
	       post-processing ones) may need them.
