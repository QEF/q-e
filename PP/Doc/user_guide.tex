\section{Introduction}

This guide covers the usage of \PostProc, version \version: 
an open-source package for postprocessing of data produced by
\PWscf\ and \CP. \PostProc\ is part of the \qe\ distribution 
and requires \PWscf\ to be installed.

This guide assumes that you know the contents of 
the general User's Guide for \qe\ and that you have
already installed \qe; that you know the physics 
behind it and the methods it implements. If not,
please locate it in directory \texttt{Doc/} two levels
above the one containing this guide;
or consult the web site:\\
\texttt{http://www.quantum-espresso.org}.

Further documentation, beyond what is provided 
in this guide, can be found in the directory
\texttt{PP/Doc/}, containing a copy of this guide.
People who want to contribute to \qe\ should read the 
Developer Manual, found in directory \texttt{Doc/} two levels
above the one containing this guide: \texttt{Doc/developer\_man.pdf}.

\section{Compilation}

\PostProc\ is distributed together with \qe.
For instruction on how to download and compile \qe, please refer 
to the general Users' Guide, available in file \texttt{Doc/user\_guide.pdf}
under the main \qe\ directory, or in web site 
\texttt{http://www.quantum-espresso.org}.

Once \qe\ is correctly configured, \PostProc\ can be compiled by
just typing \texttt{make pp}, from the main \qe\ directory;
or typing \make\ from the \texttt{PP/} subdirectory.
The executable codes that are produced in \texttt{PP/bin} are:
\begin{itemize}
\item  \texttt{pp.x} extracts the specified data from data files,
  produced by \PWscf\ (\pwx\ executable) or \CP\ (\cpx\ executable);
  prepares data for plotting by writing them into formats that can be
  read by several plotting programs. 
\item  \texttt{bands.x} extracts and reorders eigenvalues from files 
  produced by \pwx\ for band structure plotting 
\item  \texttt{projwfc.x} calculates projections of wavefunction over atomic
  orbitals, performs L\"owdin population analysis and calculates
  projected density of states. These can be summed using auxiliary
  code  \texttt{sumpdos.x}. 
\item  \texttt{plotrho.x} produces PostScript 2-d contour plots
\item  \texttt{plotband.x} reads the output of  \texttt{bands.x}, produces 
  PostScript plots of the band structure
\item  \texttt{average.x} calculates planar averages of quantities produced by
   \texttt{pp.x} (potentials, charge, magnetization densities,...) 
\item  \texttt{dos.x} calculates electronic Density of States (DOS)
\item \texttt{epsilon.x} calculates RPA frequency-dependent complex dielectric function
\item  \texttt{pw2wannier.x}: interface with Wannier90 package
\item  \texttt{wannier\_ham.x}: generate a model Hamiltonian 
in Wannier functions basis
\item  \texttt{pmw.x} generates Poor Man's Wannier functions, to be used in
  DFT+U calculations 
\end{itemize}
Note about Bader's analysis: on
\texttt{http://theory.cm.utexas.edu/bader/} one can find a software that performs
Bader's analysis starting from charge on a regular grid. The required 
"cube" format can be produced by \qe\ using  \texttt{pp.x} (info by G. Lapenna
who has successfully used this technique, but adds: ``Problems occur with polar 
X-H bonds or in all cases where the zero-flux of density comes too close to 
atoms described with pseudo-potentials"). This code should perform 
decomposition into Voronoi polyhedra as well, in place of obsolete
code  \texttt{voronoy.x} (removed from distribution since v.4.2).

\section{Post-processing}

There are a number of auxiliary codes performing postprocessing tasks such
as plotting, averaging, and so on, on the various quantities calculated by
\pwx. Such quantities are saved by \pwx\ into the output data file(s). 
Postprocessing codes are in the \texttt{PP/} directory. All codes for 
which input documentation is not explicitly mentioned have documentation
in the header of the fortran sources.

\subsection{Plotting selected quantities}
  
The main postprocessing code \texttt{pp.x} reads data file(s), extracts or calculates 
the selected quantity, writes it into a format that is suitable for plotting.

Quantities that can be read or calculated are:
\begin{quote}
      charge density\\
      spin polarization\\
      various potentials\\
      local density of states at $E_F$\\
      local density of electronic entropy\\
      STM images\\
      selected squared wavefunction\\
      ELF (electron localization function)\\
      planar averages\\
      integrated local density of states
\end{quote}
Various types of plotting (along a line, on a plane, three-dimensional, polar)
and output formats (including the popular cube format) can be specified.
The output files can be directly read by the free plotting system Gnuplot
(1D or 2D plots), or by code \texttt{plotrho.x} that comes with \PostProc\ (2D plots),
or by advanced plotting software XCrySDen and gOpenMol (3D plots).

See file \texttt{Doc/INPUT\_PP.*} for a detailed description of the input for code \texttt{pp.x}.
See Example 05 for an example of a charge density plot, Example 16
for an example of STM image simulation.

\subsection{Band structure, Fermi surface}

The code \texttt{bands.x} reads data file(s), extracts eigenvalues,
regroups them into bands (the algorithm used to order bands and to resolve
crossings may not work in all circumstances, though). The output is written
to a file in a simple format that can be directly read by plotting program
\texttt{plotband.x}. Unpredictable plots may results if k-points are not in sequence
along lines. See Example 05 directory for a simple band plot.

The code \texttt{bands.x} performs as well a symmetry analysis of the band structure:
see Example 01. 

The calculation of Fermi surface can be performed using 
\texttt{kvecs\_FS.x} and
\texttt{bands\_FS.x}. The resulting file in .xsf format can be read and plotted
using XCrySDen. See Example 08 for an example of Fermi surface 
visualization (Ni, including the spin-polarized case).

\subsection{Projection over atomic states, DOS}

The code \texttt{projwfc.x} calculates projections of wavefunctions
over atomic orbitals. The atomic wavefunctions are those contained
in the pseudopotential file(s). The L\"owdin population analysis (similar to
Mulliken analysis) is presently implemented. The projected DOS (or PDOS:
the DOS projected onto atomic orbitals) can also be calculated and written
to file(s). More details on the input data are found in file
\texttt{Doc/INPUT\_PROJWFC.*}. The ordering of the various 
angular momentum components (defined in routine \texttt{flib/ylmr2.f90})
is as follows:
$P_{0,0}(t)$, $P_{1,0}(t)$, $P_{1,1}(t)cos\phi$, $P_{1,1}(t)sin\phi$,
 $P_{2,0}(t)$, $P_{2,1}(t)cos\phi$, $P_{2,1}(t)sin\phi$, 
 $P_{2,2}(t)cos2\phi$, $P_{2,2}(t)sin2\phi$
and so on, where $P_{l,m}$=Legendre Polynomials, 
$t = cos\theta = z/r$, $\phi= atan(y /x)$.

The total electronic DOS is instead calculated by code
\texttt{dos.x}. See Example 08 for total and projected 
electronic DOS calculations.

\subsection{Wannier functions}

There are several Wannier-related utilities in \PostProc:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The "Poor Man Wannier" code \texttt{pmw.x}, to be used
in conjunction with DFT+U calculations (see Example 25)
\item The interface with Wannier90 code, \texttt{pw2wannier.x}:
see the documentation in \texttt{W90/} (you have to install the 
Wannier90 plug-in)
\item The \texttt{wannier\_ham.x} code generates a model Hamiltonian 
in Wannier functions basis: see \texttt{examples/WannierHam\_example/}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Other tools}

Code \texttt{sumpdos.x} can be used to sum selected PDOS, produced by
\texttt{projwfc.x}, by specifying the names of files
containing the desired PDOS. Type \texttt{sumpdos.x -h} or look into the source
code for more details. 

Code \texttt{epsilon.x} calculates RPA frequency-dependent complex dielectric 
function. Documentation is in file \texttt{eps\_man.tex}.

\section{Troubleshooting}

Almost all problems in \qe\ arise from incorrect input data 
and result in
error stops. Error messages should be self-explanatory, but unfortunately
this is not always true. If the code issues a warning messages and continues,
pay attention to it but do not assume that something is necessarily wrong in
your calculation: most warning messages signal harmless problems.

\paragraph{Some postprocessing codes complain that they do not find some files}
For Linux PC clusters in parallel execution: in at least some versions
of MPICH, the current directory is set to the directory where the executable
code resides, instead of being set to the directory where the code is executed.
This MPICH weirdness may cause unexpected failures in some postprocessing
codes that expect a data file in the current directory. Workaround: use
symbolic links, or copy the executable to the current directory.

\paragraph{{\em error in davcio} in postprocessing codes}
Most likely you are not reading the correct data files, or you are not
following the correct procedure for postprocessing. In parallel execution: 
if you did not set \texttt{wf\_collect=.true.}, the number of processors and 
pools for the phonon run should be the same as for the
self-consistent run; all files must be visible to all processors.
