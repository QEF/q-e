<b>Purpose of bands.x:</b>
   Re-order bands, computes band-related properties. Currently,
   re-ordering can be done with two different algorithms:
   (a) by maximising the overlap with bands at previous k-point
   (b) by computing symmetry properties of each wavefunction
   Bands-related properties that can be computed are currently
   (a) The expectation value of the spin operator on each spinor
       wave-function (noncolinear case only)
   (b) The expectation value of p

The input data can be read from standard input or from file using
command-line options &quot;bands.x -i file-name&quot; (same syntax as for pw.x)

Output files:
- file <ref>filband</ref> containing the band structure, in a format
  suitable for plotting code &quot;plotband.x&quot;
- file &quot;filband&quot;.rap (if <ref>lsym</ref> is .t.)  with symmetry information,
  to be read by plotting code &quot;plotband.x&quot;
- if (<ref>lsigma</ref>(i)): file &quot;filband&quot;.i, i=1,2,3, with expectation values
  of the spin operator in the noncolinear case
- file &quot;filband&quot;.gnu with bands in eV, directly plottable using gnuplot
- file <ref>filp</ref> with matrix elements of p (including the nonlocal potential
  contribution i*m*[V_nl,x])

If true computes expectation values of the spin operator

If .true. matrix elements of the momentum operator p between
conduction and valence bands are computed and written to file
specified in <ref>filp</ref>.
The matrix elements include the contribution from the nonlocal
potential, i*m*[V_nl, x]. In other words, the calculated matrix elements
are those of the velocity operator i*m*[H, x] times mass, not those of
the true momentum operator.

If .true. the bands are classified according to the
irreducible representations of the small group of k.
A file &quot;filband&quot;.rap with the same format of &quot;filband&quot;

If .true. writes the eigenvalues in the output file
in a 2D format readable by gnuplot. Band ordering is not
changed. Each band is written in a different file called
filband.# with the format:
<i>
   xk, yk, energy
   xk, yk, energy
   ..  ..  ..
</i>
energies are written in eV and xk in units 2\pi/a.
