	@b {Purpose of bands.x:}
	   Re-order bands, computes band-related properties. Currently,
	   re-ordering can be done with two different algorithms:
	   (a) by maximising the overlap with bands at previous k-point
           (b) by computing symmetry properties of each wavefunction
           Bands-related properties that can be computed are currently
	   (a) The expectation value of the spin operator on each spinor
               wave-function (noncolinear case only)
	   (b) The expectation value of p

        The input data can be read from standard input or from file using
	command-line options "bands.x -i file-name" (same syntax as for pw.x)	

	Output files:
	- file @ref filband containing the band structure, in a format
	  suitable for plotting code "plotband.x"
	- file "filband".rap (if @ref lsym is .t.)  with symmetry information,
	  to be read by plotting code "plotband.x"
	- if (@ref lsigma(i)): file "filband".i, i=1,2,3, with expectation values
	  of the spin operator in the noncolinear case
	- file "filband".gnu with bands in eV, directly plottable using gnuplot	
	- file @ref filp with matrix elements of p
