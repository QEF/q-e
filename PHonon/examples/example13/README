This example shows the use of th D3 code to calculate
the third-order expansion coefficients with respect to 
atomic displacement for Silicon.

First a normal self-consistent calculation is done.
Then a phonon calculation for the Gamma point is performed.
With these preliminary steps the coefficients C(0,0,0) are calculated.

For the X-point a non self-consistent calculation of groundstate
and the phonon calculation for this point is done.
Afterwards C(0,X,-X) is calculated.

By displacing one atom, one can get also these coefficients by a 
finite-difference mathod. We give first the values obtained by 
the 2n+1 method, then the values by the finite-differences.
All units are in Ryd/(a_b)^3.
