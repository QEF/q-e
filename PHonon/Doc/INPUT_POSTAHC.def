    @b {Purpose of postahc.x:}

    - Read the electron-phonon quantities calculated by @b ph.x with the
    @b electron_phonon='ahc' option.

    - Calculate the phonon-induced electron self-energy in the full matrix form
    at a given temperature.

            (Corresponds to the second term (lower Fan + lower DW) of Eq. (G1-revised) of
            J.-M. Lihm and C.-H. Park, PRX 12, 039901(E) (2022).)

            If .true., use the adiabatic approximation when computing the Fan self-energy

            to be inaccurate and even divergent in some materials (S. Ponc√© et al., J. Chem.
            Phys. 143, 102813 (2015)). Therefore, this keyword should be used only for
            experimental or debugging purposes.
