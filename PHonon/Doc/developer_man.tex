\section{Introduction}

{\em Important notice: due to the lack of time and of manpower, this
manual is only partially updated and may contain outdated information.}

\subsection{Who should read (and who should {\em write}) this guide}

The intended audience of this guide is everybody who wants to:
\begin{itemize}
\item know how the \PHonon\ package works, including its internals;
\item modify/customize/add/extend/improve/clean up the \PHonon\ package;
\item know how to read data produced by the \PHonon\ package.
\end{itemize}
The same category of people should also {\em write} this guide, of course.

\subsection{Who may read this guide but will not necessarily profit from it}

People who want to know about the capabilities of the \PHonon\ package.

People who want to know about the methods or the physics
behind \PHonon\ should read first the relevant  
literature (some pointers in the User Guide and in the Bibliography).


\section{General structure of \phx}

The behavior of the \phx\ code is controlled by a set of flags.
In a general run when all control flags are \texttt{.true.} the phonon 
code computes the following quantities in the given order:

\begin{verbatim}
                              frequency             q        perturbations

polarizability                   iu                 gamma       x,y,z 
dielectric constant               0                 gamma       x,y,z
zeu                               0                 gamma       x,y,z  
electro optic coefficient         0                 gamma       x,y,x 
raman tensor                      0                 gamma       3 x 3
dynamical matrix                  0                 all q      all irreps
zue                               0                 gamma      all irreps
electron phonon interactions      0                 all q      all irreps

zeu = Born effective charges as derivative of the forces,
zue = Born effective charges as derivative of the polarization 
\end{verbatim}

Two control flags associated to every calculated quantity 
allow to set/unset the calculation of that quantity independently from 
the others. One of these flags is an input variable:

\begin{verbatim}
fpol,             if .TRUE. computes the frequency dependent polarizability
epsil,            if .TRUE. computes the dielectric constant
zeu,              if .TRUE. computes eff. charges as induced forces
lraman,           if .TRUE. computes the raman tensor
elop,             if .TRUE. computes the el-optical coefficient
trans,            if .TRUE. computes the dynamical matrix
zue,              if .TRUE. computes eff. charges as induced polarization
elph              if .TRUE. computes the electron phonon coupling
\end{verbatim}

By default, only the \texttt{trans} flag is \texttt{.true.}.
The second flag is described in the following Section.

The phonon code contains three loops.
The outer loop is over {\bf q} points. The other two loops are inside the
{\bf q}-point loop, but they are separate and carried out sequentially. 
There is a loop over the frequencies that calculates the frequency 
dependent polarizabilities and a loop over the irreducible 
representations (\texttt{irreps}). 
In addition to this there is the calculation of the response to the electric
field. The loop over the frequencies and the response to an electric field are 
calculated only if {\bf q} is the $\Gamma$ point. The size of the loops over
the frequencies and over {\bf q} points is controlled by input variables.  

\begin{verbatim}
nfs               ! number of frequencies
fiu(nfs)          ! frequencies in Ry

nq1, nq2, nq3     ! the mesh of q points
or
xq                ! the coordinates of a q point

start_q           ! initial q to calculate
last_q            ! last q to calculate
start_irr         ! initial representation to calculate
last_irr          ! last representation to calculate
\end{verbatim}

The run can be controlled also in other two ways by the following input
variables:

\begin{verbatim}
nat_todo          ! the number of atoms to move
atomo(nat_todo)   ! which atoms to move

or

modenum           ! the response to a single mode
\end{verbatim}
The first two options limit the calculation to the representations in which
at least one of a set of atoms (specified by \texttt{atomo}) moves.
The second option calculates only the motion with respect to one 
vibrational mode.

The flow of the code can be summarized as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
1) Read input and set the flags of the quantities to compute
   1.1) Read all the quantities written by pw.x
   1.2) Read the pseudopotential data

2) Decide what must be calculated.
   2.1) If not already on disk, compute the grid of q points and 
        all the modes for all q points and save on disk (SD)
   2.2) If image parallelization is requested divide the work among images

3) In a recover run check what is already available on the .xml files and
   sets the appropriate done flags to .TRUE.

4) Start a main loop over the q points:

   4.1) Compute all quantities that do not depend on the response of the system
   4.2) Check if a band calculation is needed and do it.
   NB: the following points are executed only when q is Gamma.
     4.3) Start a loop on the frequencies
          4.3.1) Compute the polarizability as a function of iu SD
     4.4) Compute the response to an electric field 
     4.5) Compute epsilon and SD
     4.6) Compute zeu and SD
     4.7) Compute the electro-optic coefficient and SD
     4.8) Compute the second order response to E
     4.9) Compute Raman tensor and SD
   END NB

5) Start a loop over the irreducible representation 
     5.1) Compute the response to an irreducible representation
     5.1.1) Accumulate the contribution to electron-phonon SD
     5.1.2) Accumulate the contribution to the dynamical matrix 
     5.1.3) Accumulate the contribution to zue 
     5.1.4) SD this contribution to the dynamical matrix and to zue
continue the loop 5) until all representations of the current q point
have been computed

6) diagonalize the dynamical matrix and SD (only if all representations of 
   this q have been computed)

7) Sum over k and bands the electron-phonon couplings to calculate gamma_mat
   SD (only if all representations of this q have been computed)

8) continue the loop at point 4 until all q points have been computed

\end{verbatim}

In more detail the quantities calculated by the phonon code and
the routines where these quantities are calculated are:

\begin{itemize}

\item
4.2.1) The polarization as a function of the complex frequency is a
\texttt{3x3} real tensor for each frequency: \texttt{polar(3,3,nfs)} 
(calculated in \texttt{polariz}). These quantities are presently written 
on output.

\item
4.5) The dielectric constant is a real \texttt{3x3} tensor: 
\texttt{epsilon} (calculated in \texttt{dielec}). 

\item
4.6) Zeu is a real array: \texttt{zstareu(3,3,nat)}. The first index is 
the electric field, while the other two indices give the atom that moves and the
direction. 

\item
The electro-optic tensor is a three indices tensor \texttt{eloptns(3,3,3)}
that is calculated by the routine \texttt{el\_opt}. It requires the response
to the electric field perturbation.

\item
The raman tensor is a real array \texttt{ramtns(3,3,3,nat)} that
gives the derivatives of the dielectric constant when the atom nat moves.
The third index give the direction of the displacement.
It requires the first and the second order response of the wavefunctions
with respect to the electric field perturbation. It is calculated
by the routine \texttt{raman\_mat}.

\item The dynamical matrix is a complex matrix of dimensions
\texttt{(3 * nat, 3 * nat)}. It is calculated by three routines:
\texttt{dynmat0} computes the part that does not require the linear
response of the system. It has an ion-ion term, a term common to NC, US, and
PAW scheme and the nonlinear core correction term. 
The US and PAW schemes have additional parts, 
one of them calculated inside \texttt{dynmat0} with a call to
\texttt{addusdynmat}, and another part calculated in \texttt{drho}.
There is then a contribution that requires the response of the
wavefunctions calculated in \texttt{drhodv} and \texttt{drhodvloc}
which is common to the NC, US, and PAW schemes. The latter two schemes
have other contributions calculated in \texttt{drhodvus}. This
routine contains also the additional PAW term.

\item
5.1.3 Zue is a real array: \texttt{zstarue(3,nat,3)}. The first two indices 
give the atom that moves and the direction, the third gives the electric 
field. 

\item
The electron phonon coefficients are explained in the \PHonon\ user guide. 
\phx\ saves on \texttt{.xml} files $g_{{\bf q},\nu} ({\bf k},i,j)$ 
for all the modes of an irreducible representation. The coefficients are
saved for each {\bf k} and for all the perturbations. Each irreducible
representation is contained in a different file (see below). Note that 
these quantities are gauge dependent, so if you calculate them on 
different machines with the GRID parallelization, you can use them only 
for gauge invariant quantities. Be very careful with it. (still at an 
experimental stage).

\end{itemize}

All the quantities calculated by the phonon code are saved in the
\texttt{fildyn} files with the exception of the
polarization as a function of the complex frequency that is written 
on output, and of the electron phonon coefficients. The output of the
code in the latter case is given by the files {\tt a2Fq2r.\#.\#iq}.

The charge density response to the electric field perturbations and
to the atomic displacements, or the change of the Kohn and Sham
potential can be saved on disk giving appropriate input variables.
These quantities are saved on disk by \texttt{solve\_e} and 
\texttt{solve\_linter}.


\section{GRID parallelization and recover}

The \phx\ code might start from scratch or recover an interrupted run. 
In a recover run the input control flags are assumed to coincide with 
those used in the interrupted run. The required quantities might be
found in \texttt{.xml} recover files and do not need to be recalculated. 
If the quantities are found on file the following flags become 
\texttt{.TRUE.}.

\begin{verbatim}
done_fpol,          if .TRUE. all frequency dependent polarizabilities are known
done_epsil,         if .TRUE. the dielectric constant is known
done_start_zstar,   if .TRUE. zstareu0 is known
done_zeu,           if .TRUE. zeu is known
done_lraman,        if .TRUE. the raman tensor is known
done_elop,          if .TRUE. the electron-optical coefficient is known
done_zue,           if .TRUE. zue is known
done_elph           if .TRUE. the electron-phonon coupling coefficient is known
\end{verbatim}
%done_trans,         if .TRUE. the dynamical matrix is known

The variables that control the grid are:

\begin{verbatim}
comp_iq(nqs)=.TRUE.              ! .FALSE. when this q is not computed in 
                                 ! this run (controlled by start_q, last_q,
                                 ! or by the image controller)

comp_irr_iq(0:3*nat,nqs)=.TRUE.  ! .FALSE. for the representations that are
                                 !  not calculated in this run.
                                 ! (controlled by start_q, last_q, 
                                 !  start_irr, last_irr, 
                                 !  or by the image controller)

comp_iu(nfs)=.TRUE.              ! .FALSE. for the frequencies not calculated 
                                 ! in this run. 

\end{verbatim}

These variables are set at the beginning of the run on the basis of
the input and of the number of images requested by the calculation.
If this is a recover run some of these quantities might be already
available on file. The code checks what is already saved on files and
sets the corresponding flags:

\begin{verbatim}
done_iu(nfs)=.FALSE.        ! .TRUE. when the polarization(iu) is available.

done_iq(nqs)=.FALSE.        ! .TRUE. when the dyn. mat. and, if required, the
                            ! electron-phonon coefficients at the q point 
                            ! have been calculated

done_bands(nqs)=.FALSE.     ! .TRUE. when the bands for that q are already 
                            !  on disk

done_irr_iq(0:3*nat,nqs)=.FALSE. ! The representations that have been already 
                                 ! calculated for each q are set .TRUE.. 
                                 ! The representation 0 is the part of the
                                 ! dynamical matrix computed by drho and
                                 ! dynmat0.

done_elph_iq(3*nat,nqs)=.FALSE.  ! .TRUE. when the electron phonon coefficient 
                                 ! for this irreducible representation and
                                 ! this q is available.

\end{verbatim}

The phonon code might stop in the middle of a self-consistent linear response 
run, or while it is computing the bands. This case is controlled  
by a single code that is read from the files written on disk.
This is an integer that tells where the code stopped. This code
is used in several points to avoid too many flags checks. Saved
on disk in \texttt{.xml} file there is also a string.  
The codes are the following:
\newpage

\begin{verbatim}
!  rec_code   where_rec     status description

\end{verbatim}


\section{Parallelization}

The \PHonon\ package uses the same parallelization mechanisms of the \qe\
package. See the Developer manual in the \texttt{Doc} directory
two levels above this one for more information.
It is parallelized on plane-waves, pools, bands, and images.
The \texttt{-ortho} flag is not used. \texttt{Scalapack} routines are not 
used in the \phx\ code.

Each tensor should be collected as soon as it is calculated
and all processors must have the same tensors. Please avoid to collect
tensors in routines distant from where they are calculated. There might be
exception to this rule for efficiency, but please try not to abuse for
small arrays. Only collected quantities are saved on the \texttt{.xml} file,
so they should not depend on the parallelization level. Note that only ionode
writes the \texttt{.xml} files, so you have different \texttt{xml} files only 
for different images. The variables are then broadcasted to all processors 
in an image.

\section{Files produced by ph.x}

The output files of the \pwx\ code are not modified by the \phx\ code. 
Each image of \phx\ creates a new directory called \texttt{outdir/\_ph\#} 
where it writes its files. \texttt{\#} is an integer equal to \texttt{0} 
in a calculation with one image or to the image number when the 
\texttt{-nimage} flag is used. 
There are two sets of files written 
by \phx\ in the \texttt{outdir/\_ph\#} directories: unformatted files 
containing internal arrays, and \texttt{.xml} 
files containing partial results or tensors. The former are in 
\texttt{outdir/\_ph\#} if the input flag \texttt{lqdir=.false.}, or in 
separate subdirectories \texttt{outdir/\_ph\#/prefix.q\_\#iq},
where \texttt{\#iq} is the number of the {\bf q} point. Note that if 
\texttt{lqdir=.false.} (default is \texttt{lqdir=elph})
the disk occupation is reduced but the files of each {\bf q} point are
rewritten by the following {\bf q} so it is not possible to run an 
electron-phonon calculation with \texttt{trans=.false.} and 
\texttt{ldisp=.true.} after generating the induced potentials for a mesh of 
{\bf q} points. 
The \texttt{.xml} files calculated by each image are in the 
\texttt{outdir/\_ph\#/{prefix}.phsave} directory for all {\bf q}-vectors and 
irreps calculated by that images. Before closing the image calculation 
the content of all the \texttt{outdir/\_ph\#/{prefix}.phsave}
directories are copied into \texttt{outdir/\_ph0/{prefix}.phsave} directory, so
it is possible to recover the calculation without using images.
The \phx\ code reads the output of \pwx\ from the \texttt{outdir} directory. 
The wavefunctions are in \texttt{outdir/{prefix}.wfc} files 
while information on the structure of the solid and on the \pwx\ 
run are in the \texttt{outdir/{prefix}.save} directory. The wavefunctions are 
also in this directory if \pwx\ was run with the \texttt{wf\_collect=.true.} 
flag. These files are not modified by \phx. 
At a finite {\bf q} vector, \phx\ runs its own instance of \pwx\
to compute the bands and saves the results into 
the \texttt{outdir/\_ph\#/prefix.q\_\#iq} directory (\texttt{lqdir=.true.}) or
in \texttt{outdir/\_ph\#}. The charge density is copied inside 
these directories before calculating the bands. The output of \pwx\ is 
in files called \texttt{outdir/\_ph\#/prefix.q\_\#iq/{prefix}.wfc} and in 
the directory 
{\tt outdir/\_ph\#/prefix.q\_\#iq/prefix.save} (\texttt{lqdir=.true.}),
or in \texttt{outdir/\_ph\#/{prefix}.wfc} and in 
\texttt{outdir/\_ph\#/{prefix}.save} (\texttt{lqdir=.false.}). With
\texttt{lqdir=.false.} \phx\ saves in 
\texttt{outdir/\_ph\#/{prefix}.bar} the
non self-consistent part of the right hand side of the linear system, 
in \texttt{outdir/\_ph\#/{prefix}.dwf} the change of the wavefunctions. 
The files \texttt{outdir/\_ph\#/} \texttt{{prefix}.igk} contain the ${\bf k}+{\bf G}$ 
lists as in the \pwx\ run.
With US or PAW, files called \texttt{outdir/\_ph\#/{prefix}.prd} 
contain the induced charge density, for all modes. 
Only the part that does not depend on the perturbed wavefunctions 
is contained in these files. With electric field perturbations 
there are also files called \texttt{outdir/\_ph\#/{prefix}.com} that 
contain $P_c x |\psi\rangle$ and are needed for the calculation 
of the Born effective charges.
The mixing routine saves its data in files called 
\texttt{outdir/\_ph\#/{prefix}.mixd}. 
The status of \phx\ is saved at each iteration in files called
\texttt{outdir/\_ph\#/{prefix}.recover}. These files can be used 
to recover the run. All these unformatted files are saved in 
\texttt{outdir/\_ph\#/prefix.q\_\#iq} directory when \texttt{lqdir=.true.}.
Using the input flag \texttt{reduce\_io=.true.} these files can be
kept in memory and saved only at the end of the run if necessary.

In parallel calculations, previous files are split into several files 
that have a final number. Each number labels the processor that wrote the 
file. There are as many files as processors per image. 

The files with the dynamical matrices are written in the directory in
which \phx\ is started and are called \texttt{{fildyn}\#iq} where 
\texttt{\#iq} is the {\bf q}-vector number in a dispersion calculation, 
or is not added in a single-{\bf q} calculation. Only one copy of this 
file is written in a parallel run. When the \texttt{-nimage} option
is used some of these files might be empty (if the corresponding {\bf q}
point has been divided between two or more images). The results are
collected running \phx\ another time (with \texttt{recover=.true.})
without images.

Moreover \phx\ opens a directory called \texttt{outdir/\_ph\#/{prefix}.phsave}.
This directory contains the partial information on the calculation.
These files can be used to recover a run also when the recover file 
is corrupted. In the directory {\tt outdir/\_ph\#/{prefix}.phsave} the 
files are in \texttt{.xml} format. Note that this directory is
always in \texttt{outdir/\_ph\#/} also when \texttt{lqdir=.true.}.
There are several files:

\texttt{control\_ph.xml} contains information on the flags that control
what \phx\ calculates. The content of this file is used mainly for 
checking purposes. The code reads these flags in input and does not need
to reread them from file, but a recover run in which these flags change 
is not allowed. \texttt{control\_ph.xml} contains also the mesh of 
{\bf q}-vectors and their coordinates. This file is written only in a non 
recovered calculation from the routine \texttt{check\_initial\_status} after 
the creation of the {\bf q}-vector mesh. It is read, if 
\texttt{recover=.true.}, at the beginning of 
the run by \texttt{phq\_readin}.

\texttt{status\_run.xml} contains information that tell \phx\ 
at which point the code stopped. It has information on the current 
{\bf q} vector, the current frequency, and a recover code that tells 
\phx\ if it has to expect a recover file and which routine produced this 
recover file. 
\texttt{status\_run.xml} file is rewritten each time the phonon code 
reaches a point from which a new recover is possible.
It is read, if \texttt{recover=.true.},
at the beginning of the run by \texttt{phq\_readin}.

If some routine wrote it, \texttt{tensors.xml} contains the tensors that
have been calculated. Possible tensors are: dielectric constant, 
Born effective charges calculated as derivative of the forces (EU), 
Born effective charges calculated as derivative of the polarization (UE), 
raman tensor, electro-optic coefficient. This file is written by the 
routines that calculate the tensors. 
It is read by the routine \texttt{phq\_recover}, if \texttt{recover=.true.} 
and the {\bf q} vector is $\Gamma$.

If \texttt{polariz} wrote it, \texttt{polariz.xml} contains the frequency
dependent polarizabilities for the frequencies calculated so far. 
It is read by the routine 
\texttt{phq\_recover}, if \texttt{recover=.true.} and the {\bf q} vector
is $\Gamma$.

\texttt{patterns.\#iq.xml} are files written for each {\bf q} vector 
(\texttt{\#iq} is its number).
They contain the information on the displacement patterns that 
transform according to irreducible representations of the small 
group of {\bf q}: number of irreducible representations, their dimensions, 
the displacement patterns and the name of the irreducible representation 
to which each mode belongs. It is written in nonrecover runs by the routine 
\texttt{init\_representations}.
It is read for each {\bf q} vector by \texttt{phq\_setup}. The routine
reads the data of the file with \texttt{iq=current\_iq}.

\texttt{dynmat.\#iq.0.xml} contains the part of the dynamical matrix 
calculated by \texttt{dynmat0} that does not depend on the perturbed 
wavefunctions. It is written by \texttt{dynmat0} and read only in recover runs
by \texttt{phq\_recover}.

\texttt{dynmat.\#iq.\#irr.xml}
contains the contribution to the dynamical matrix at the 
{\bf q} vector \texttt{\#iq} of
the representation \texttt{\#irr}. 
Note that these files can be calculated independently even on 
different machines and collected in a single directory (see the GRID example),
but it is necessary to calculate the patterns file in a single machine and
send it to all the machine where the calculation is run to be sure that
all machines use the same displacement patterns.
When the files \texttt{dynmat.\#iq.\#irr.xml} are present for all 
\texttt{\#irr} of a given \texttt{\#iq} the dynamical matrix for that 
${\bf q}$ can be calculated. If all the \texttt{\#irr} of a given symmetry 
for a given \texttt{\#iq} are present, 
the partial dynamical matrix that can be constructed with this information 
can be diagonalized and the frequencies of the modes of that symmetry can 
be calculated (using the \texttt{ldiag=.true.} flag).
These files are written by \texttt{phqscf} after calculating the 
contribution of the representation to the dynamical matrix by 
\texttt{drhodv}. They are read only in recover runs by the routine 
\texttt{phq\_recover}.

\texttt{elph.\#iq.\#irr.xml} contains the contribution to the electron 
phonon coefficients 
at the {\bf q} vector \texttt{\#iq} of the representation \texttt{\#irr}. 
These files are written by \texttt{elphel} and contain the quantities 
$g_{{\bf q}\nu} ({\bf k}, i, j)$ 
(see User Manual). They are read in recover runs by the routine 
\texttt{phq\_recover}.


\section{The routines of the PHonon package}

The routines of the \PHonon\ package can be divided in groups of  
related task. There are high level drivers that call the
routines that do the actual work and low level routines that make
a single task. Note that the phonon code is tightly integrated in the QE
package, so it uses the routines provided by the 
\texttt{Modules} or by the \texttt{PW/src} directories. Only a brief comment
on the purpose and the use of the routines can be found here. More details
might be written inside the routines themselves. We report here the name of the
file that contains the routines. Each file might contain more than one
routine. Unfortunately sometimes there is no correspondence between the name of
the file and the name of the routine. This is mainly for historical reasons.
We adopt the following convention: if the file and the routine contained inside
have the same name we report only the filename; if the file contains a single
routine with a different name or more than one routine, we report in 
parenthesis the routine name.

Modules that contain the variables used by \phx:

\begin{verbatim}
phcom.f90  Almost all global variables are here.
elph.f90   Variables needed for the electron-phonon part.

\section{Suggestion for developers}

If you plan to add something to the \texttt{PHonon} package follow these
simple rules:

\begin{itemize}

\item
All quantities that do not require the perturbed wavefunctions, are
calculated in setup or by calling a separate routine in \texttt{phq\_init}. 

\item
The quantities that require the perturbed wavefunctions due to an
electric field are calculated by a separate routine after 
\texttt{solve\_e} in the routine \texttt{phescf}.

\item
The quantities that require the perturbed wavefunctions due to an
atomic displacement are accumulated by calling a separate routine
in phqscf after \texttt{solve\_linter}. 
NB: the perturbed wavefunctions are saved in a file that is rewritten at
each new \texttt{irrep}.

\item
After calculating a quantity, it has to be saved in the directory
\texttt{outdir} in an \texttt{.xml} file, by adding it to the list 
of variables in the routine \texttt{write\_tensors}  
(preferable), or by writing a routine similar to \texttt{write\_tensors} 
that writes a separate file. The same quantity must be read by 
\texttt{read\_tensors} or by writing a separate routine.

\item
If you introduce the calculation of a new quantity in the phonon code 
and save it in the \texttt{.xml} file, please add also the associated flags 
that control the calculation: 
\texttt{lquantity} is read in input and tells \phx\ that that quantity must be 
calculated, \texttt{done\_quantity} tells \phx\ that that quantity 
was available in the \texttt{.xml} files and should not be recalculated, 
\texttt{comp\_quantity} can be introduced if the quantity depends on 
{\bf q} or on the frequency and tells \phx\ that that quantity must be 
calculated in this run. The image controller can divide the work among images
by setting the array \texttt{comp\_quantity}. At each {\bf q} point and 
at each frequency the quantity must be saved in the \texttt{.xml} file.
Please update the image controller to add the additional work that the 
calculation of your quantity involves and make a single image calculate it 
or divide the work among different images.

\item
Please, try to avoid opening files inside routines.
Files must be opened in \texttt{openfilq} and closed in \texttt{close\_phq}.

\item
Global variables must be allocated in \texttt{allocate\_phq}, directly in the 
routine, or by calling a separate routine that allocates all
your new variables. The same variables must be deallocated in 
\texttt{deallocate\_phq}, by a separate routine or by adding them to the
list of variables. Note that at each new {\bf q} point these variables are
deallocated and reallocated. 

\item
Variables that control the grid should not be deallocated at
each new {\bf q} point must be allocated in \texttt{allocate\_grid\_variables} 
and deallocated in \texttt{destroy\_status\_run}.
A few arrays that must be read from input are allocated in 
\texttt{phq\_readin} after reading their size and deallocated in
\texttt{destroy\_status\_run}.

\item
Preferably global variables are calculated by in a single routine 
and used by the other routines. In particular routines are not allowed to 
modify:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  The variables calculated by \pwx.
\item
  The modes.
\item
  The variables that describe the symmetry of the small group of {\bf q}.
\item
  The variables that describe the response of the ultrasoft quantities
        (e.g. \texttt{int1}, \texttt{int2}, ..., \texttt{alphasum}, 
\texttt{becsum}, \texttt{dpqq}, etc.).
\end{itemize}
If you need to modify these quantities, please allocate new variables 
and copy the variables of the phonon on them.

\item
If you want to establish a new recover point, add the appropriate
\texttt{rec\_code} in the list above. The point in which the code stopped 
is saved in \texttt{prefix.phsave/status\_run.xml}. 

\end{itemize}

If you are searching for some interesting project to contribute to the
\texttt{PHonon} package, please read the header of \texttt{phonon.f90}
and implement some feature that is not yet ready. Ideally all quantities
should be at level [10], presently level [5] is still experimental and
some quantities are at level [1].
